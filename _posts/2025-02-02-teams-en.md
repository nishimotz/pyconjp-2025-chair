This is the 9th daily report published by [@nishimotz](https://d.nishimotz.com/aboutme), the Chair of PyCon JP 2025, in their personal capacity.

[PyCon JP 2025](https://2025.pycon.jp/) will be held on September 26-27 at the Hiroshima International Conference Center.

[We are currently recruiting organizing members.](https://pyconjp.blogspot.com/2024/12/call-for-organizing-members-ja.html)

Please note that at present, applications for organizing members are limited to residents of Japan.

The knowledge base from previous PyCon JP operations is publicly available in the [Knowledge Base](https://pyconjp.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/pyconjp/pages/846528558/Teams).

Based on this knowledge and discussions with PyCon JP 2025 organizing members, we will establish specific operational structures.

## Teams

PyCon JP 2025 organizing members will be divided into teams, with activities conducted by team.

To reduce anxiety about the venue change and accommodate experienced members, we decided to maintain the previous structure except for the "Chair Team."

Here are the initial action items for each team:

### Program Team

- Keynote speakers
- Call for Proposals (CFP)
- Talk selection
- Tutorial recruitment
- Development sprints
- Poster sessions
- Lightning talks
- Invited talks

### Sponsor Team

- Sponsorship guidelines
- Sponsor information sessions
- Sponsor recruitment
- Sponsor relations
- Sponsor booth setup guidance

### Venue Team

- Venue management
- Food and beverages
- Network infrastructure
- Streaming and archiving
- Party organization
- Childcare services

### Public Relations Team

- Website management
- Design

### Participant Management Team

- Ticket sales preparation

### Chair Team

We're considering combining the chair and accounting roles into one team that also serves as an overall coordinator. This decision comes from understanding that last year's accounting team was deeply involved in overall planning beyond just managing income and expenses.

Responsibilities include:

- Overall concept and theme
- Code of conduct and policy development/implementation
- Budget management
- Organizing member recruitment
- Organizing member mentoring
- Progress management across teams
- Coordination of cross-team tasks and unclear jurisdictions
- Accounting

All teams' activities will evolve as preparations progress.

## Leaders and Sub-leaders

Organizing members come from diverse backgrounds, regardless of experience level or whether they're local to the venue.

We want to entrust team leadership and sub-leadership roles to those who can dedicate significant time to activities. Leaders and sub-leaders will be selected from organizing members.

However, leadership changes are possible if unavoidable circumstances arise, with such situations managed by the Chair Team.

Note that the Chair Team will not have designated leaders and sub-leaders.

Additional policy proposals:

- Multiple sub-leaders are acceptable
- One person should not serve as leader or sub-leader for multiple teams

I personally served as a sub-leader of the Participant Management Team for PyCon JP 2024, attending meetings and work sessions as much as possible. Of course, this was achieved through cooperation with the leader and other team members.

## Vice Chair

We will establish a Vice Chair position as a sub-leader role in the Chair Team.

I believe the ideal Vice Chair would be an "enthusiastic" person, regardless of experience level, who wants to actively participate in the organization.

We welcome Vice Chairs who can provide perspective from the local community (or those living in regions aiming for future local hosting) or newcomers' viewpoints, and hopefully lead fun initiatives.

As Chair, I want to manage "what needs to be done" while enabling the Vice Chair to lead "what we want to do," supporting everyone's initiatives.

The Vice Chair will also be selected from organizing members, and this position need not be limited to one person.

## More on PyCon JP 2025 Concept

While I've written about the concept in [previous reports](https://pyconjp-2025-chair.nishimotz.com/2025/01/21/concepts-for-pycon-jp.html), there are additional considerations.

Here's a Python technology outlook for the coming years, created with various AI tools:

- AI & Machine Learning: Python demand will increase with the proliferation of generative AI and large-scale models
- Web & Cloud Development: Framework evolution and cloud-native design will expand Python's usage
- Performance Improvements: JIT and static typing tools will enhance execution speed and code quality
- Embedded & IoT: MicroPython's growth will expand IoT market usage
- Community Activation: Global community development of new technologies and tools will drive innovation

Based on this, "Building Bridges Between Beginners and Cutting-edge Technology" could be our core concept.

To provide value for both learners and experts, we're setting two core themes:

### 1. Python's Frontier â€“ Practicing and Applying New Technologies

- Hands-on sessions and implementation cases for AI/ML, Mojo, PyO3, Web3, etc.
- Discussions on competing languages, performance optimization, and security challenges

### 2. Python Learning and Career Development

- Learning methods utilizing generative AI, beginner workshops, practical project support
- Community engagement, starting OSS contributions, industry career path development

### Speaking of Bridges

Hiroshima is known for its many rivers and bridges throughout the city.

We hope to build many bridges between learners and experts.
