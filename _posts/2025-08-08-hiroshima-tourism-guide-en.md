Hello! I'm Nishimoto, Chair of PyCon JP 2025. This is day 37 of my #100-day challenge note series.

PyCon JP 2025 will be held at Hiroshima International Conference Center from September 26 (Friday) to 28 (Sunday), 2025. Two days of conference, with the final day dedicated to development sprints.

Why not plan a leisurely journey to explore Hiroshima while joining this event where you can connect with Python community members from across Japan and around the world?

This article presents a travel plan I've personally crafted around PyCon JP 2025. I'd love for others to provide detailed information about each destination!

*This post is based on my [note article "What Tourism Opportunities Are Available in Hiroshima?"](https://note.com/24motz/n/n6de670f8bbde) from June 30, part of my #100-day challenge.*
