Hello, this is Nishimotz, the Chair of PyCon JP 2025.

PyCon JP 2025 will be held at Hiroshima International Conference Center from September 26-28, 2025 (the final day is for development sprints). We're now just two months away! PyCon JP is Japan's largest Python community event, an international nonprofit conference organized primarily by Python community members.

Today, I want to explain **"Patron Tickets"**‚Äîa special type of ticket that's a bit different from others.

*This post is based on my [note article "What is a Patron Ticket?"](https://note.com/24motz/n/na043f140237d) from July 26, part of my #100-day challenge.*

## I've Been a Patron Before

When PyCon APAC 2023 was held instead of PyCon JP that year, I was a patron. Let me share a photo from the venue showing the patron recognition panel.

This experience gives me a personal perspective on what it means to be a patron, and I'd like to share that feeling with you today.

## What is a "Patron"?

First, let's understand what the word **"patron"** means. A patron is primarily someone who provides economic support as a "benefactor" in fields like arts, culture, and academia. Historically, famous examples include the Medici family, who supported Leonardo da Vinci.

From this meaning of "benefactor," special tickets to support events are called "patron tickets."

## The Patron Ticket Experience

Whether it's your favorite artist's concert, a creator's exhibition you want to support, or technical conferences like the one I participated in‚Äîmany events involve "tickets." Among these, **"patron tickets" are special tickets purchased by adding a "support contribution (expression of support)" to the regular participation fee,** often with additional benefits.

It's a way to step beyond being just a "participant" and become a "benefactor (patron)" who supports the event‚Äî**a form of intentional declaration.**

## PyCon JP 2025 Patron Tickets

PyCon JP 2025 patron tickets differ from "Early Bird" tickets (which I discussed yesterday) in several ways:

### **Key Differences:**
- **Price**: Higher investment reflecting patron status
- **Official party participation rights**: Included (separate purchase for other tickets)
- **Name listing on official website**: Public recognition as a patron
- **Name display at venue**: Physical recognition during the event

The official party details will be explained separately later. For now, understand that **"the price difference includes some content differences too."**

**"Name listing" is proof of your patron status.** While the price is higher than regular tickets, I believe you gain even more value than the additional cost.

## My Personal Motivation

When I became a patron in 2023, I didn't have any grand reasons. However, looking back at this photo of the recognition panel now, **it's not just a record of participation, but a tangible sense that "I was also part of creating this wonderful experience."**

I certainly felt respect seeing the names and images of other patrons. Some are frequent PyCon JP participants, others have made significant contributions to the Python community, and some are active in social media engagement.

**When you see patron sponsors, it becomes a natural conversation starter:** "You're a patron sponsor, right?" Or alternatively, **becoming a patron yourself can be a way to create opportunities for others to approach you.**

## Who Becomes a Patron?

Patrons typically include people who:
- **Have economic capacity** to support beyond basic participation
- **Want to contribute** to the community's growth and sustainability
- **Seek recognition** for their support and involvement
- **Value networking opportunities** with other committed community members
- **Believe in the mission** of PyCon JP and Python community development

## The Value Beyond Price

### **üèÜ Recognition & Status**
- **Public acknowledgment** of your community support
- **Networking catalyst** with other committed community members
- **Lasting record** of your contribution to PyCon JP 2025
- **Professional visibility** within the Python community

### **üéâ Enhanced Experience**
- **Official party access** included in your ticket
- **Exclusive networking opportunities** with speakers, organizers, and sponsors
- **Premium event experience** with additional amenities
- **Direct impact** on conference quality through your support

### **ü§ù Community Impact**
- **Financial contribution** helps improve overall conference quality
- **Support for accessibility** programs and student participation
- **Investment in future** PyCon JP events and community growth
- **Model for others** considering their own level of support

## For International Patrons

**Being an international patron carries special significance:**

### **üåè Global Community Leadership**
- **Bridge building** between international and Japanese Python communities
- **Cultural exchange** facilitation through your enhanced participation
- **International representation** in patron recognition
- **Long-term relationship** building with Japanese tech community

### **üí° Professional Benefits**
- **Increased visibility** in Asian Python markets
- **Networking access** to Japanese tech industry leaders
- **Cultural competency** demonstration through community support
- **International collaboration** opportunities

## The Recognition Experience

As someone who has been recognized as a patron, **I can tell you that the feeling goes beyond transactional.** When your name appears on the website and at the venue:

- **Pride in contribution** to something meaningful
- **Connection to legacy** of PyCon JP and its community
- **Conversation starter** for meaningful professional relationships
- **Tangible impact** on the event's success and accessibility

The recognition isn't just about your name being displayed‚Äî**it's about being part of the story of PyCon JP 2025.**

## Making the Decision

### **Consider Patron Tickets If You:**
- Want to make a **meaningful contribution** to Python community development
- Value **enhanced networking opportunities** and exclusive access
- Seek **professional visibility** within the Python ecosystem
- Believe in **supporting accessibility** and community growth
- Want to be **permanently recognized** as a PyCon JP 2025 benefactor

### **Patron vs. Other Tickets:**
- **Early Bird/Personal**: Focus on participation and value
- **Student/U25**: Focus on accessibility and learning
- **Patron**: Focus on community support and recognition

## Beyond Transactions: Building Community

**Patron tickets represent more than premium access‚Äîthey're investments in the Python community's future.** Your support:

- **Enables student participation** through subsidized programs
- **Improves accessibility** features and international support
- **Enhances content quality** through better speaker support
- **Builds sustainability** for future PyCon JP events
