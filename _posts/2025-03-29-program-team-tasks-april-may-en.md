With about 6 months remaining until PyCon JP 2025, the Program Team now has a leader who will guide the team's activities going forward. This article is shared as a foundation for aligning everyone's understanding of the tasks that the Program Team will be working on from April to May.

## Chair's Vision

PyCon JP 2025 represents an important step in expanding the Python community beyond Tokyo.

Reflecting the current state where Python is spreading in fields such as education, we welcome the introduction of Python use cases from regional areas and aim to create a venue where Python users from diverse backgrounds can come together.

We aim to create content that first-time participants can enjoy, and our goal is to widely communicate that "PyCon JP is an event where newcomers can enjoy themselves with peace of mind."

Here are our specific goals:

- Encourage past PyCon JP participants to continue attending and contributing
- Position PyCon JP as a preferred choice for speakers looking for technical conference opportunities
- Gather content that first-time participants can enjoy, making PyCon JP truly "an event where newcomers can enjoy themselves with peace of mind"

## Main Program Team Tasks

### Keynote Speaker Related

- **April**: Finalizing and Announcing Keynote Speakers
  - Collecting information from confirmed speakers (profiles, talk outlines, etc.)
  - Preparing to announce the confirmed keynote speakers

In selecting keynote speakers, we aim to consider individuals with diverse perspectives and backgrounds, reflecting the significance of holding the event in Hiroshima.

### Call for Proposals (CFP) Related

- **April**: Launching the CFP
  - Aiming to launch the CFP in the first week of April (however, prioritizing proper preparation over strict adherence to this timeline)
  - Carefully organizing what needs to be communicated to submitters and ensuring that the concepts and ideals of PyCon JP 2025 are clearly conveyed

Here are some potential themes we are considering for the CFP:

- Machine learning and AI
- System operations and DevOps
- Education and community
- Regional-specific problem solving

We will also explicitly welcome Python use cases from Hiroshima and other regional areas, and encourage mathematical and scientific topics related to Python 3.14 (Ï€).

The following were the review criteria used in 2024:
1. Relevance: Is the content related to the Python community?
2. Clarity: Is the talk content clearly written?
3. Expertise: Is the content based on personal experience or specialized knowledge?
4. Practicality: Is the content interesting or useful?
5. Diversity: Does it reflect various perspectives and experiences?
