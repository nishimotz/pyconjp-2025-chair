## Introduction

I express my heartfelt gratitude to everyone who has decided to come to Hiroshima and to those who submitted proposals. I apologize for any inconvenience caused by VISA invitation letters and travel grant procedures. We are working with all teams to improve and address these issues. If you have any questions or delays, please don't hesitate to contact us. I personally review all inquiries from international attendees and respond as promptly as possible.

## Important Information

- Procedures: VISA invitation letters and travel grants are being handled individually.
- [Tickets](https://pyconjp.connpass.com/event/359523/): Early bird tickets are limited. [The official party](https://pyconjp.connpass.com/event/361700/) on Friday, September 26th requires a separate ticket (except for Patron/Business tickets). We'll provide Hiroshima-style cuisine.
- U25 tickets are special discount tickets for those 25 years old and under (not 25 USD).
- Sprint: Development sprint on Sunday, September 28th is being prepared. Beginners to experienced developers welcome.
- Special Needs: For accessibility, dietary restrictions, religious considerations, childcare, etc., please contact us through the official inquiry system early. These requests receive top priority.

## Speakers and Poster Presenters

Many international attendees are speakers and poster presenters. We're accepting questions about slide/poster specifications, day-of proceedings, venue facilities, recording and material publication policies. We're coordinating with teams to prepare responses.

## Social Media

For casual questions about transportation, accommodation, and sightseeing, feel free to use the [PyConJP2025](https://x.com/hashtag/PyConJP2025) hashtag on X.

The Chair frequently monitors this hashtag.

## Transportation

Hiroshima's public transportation accepts Japan's nationwide IC cards (Suica, etc.). Fare payment methods vary by route - some require tapping both when boarding and alighting, others only when alighting after showing the driver. Follow the displayed instructions or ask the staff.

Taxis can be arranged through Uber. Japanese taxi apps like GO and DiDi are also widely available.

## Shopping and Dining

Many stores in the city accept cashless payments including credit cards, with an increasing number of restaurants supporting tap payments. However, some establishments only accept cash or QR code payments.

More stores now offer self-checkout and self-ordering systems with English language options.

## Climate

For reference, Hiroshima's climate at the end of September last year ranged from 31-34째C (88-93째F) highs to 22-25째C (72-77째F) lows. This year may also have hot, humid summer weather. Indoor venues are air-conditioned, so bringing a light jacket is recommended.

## Power and Communication

Japan uses Type-A plugs with 100V.

The venue will provide Wi-Fi and power outlets.

Hiroshima City operates the ["HIROSHIMA FREE Wi-Fi"](https://dive-hiroshima.com/information/wifi/) public wireless service.

## Emergency

Emergency contact methods and on-site support details will be announced on the official website and social media closer to the event, after coordination with organizing members.

## Language and Cultural Bridge

Simultaneous interpretation will be provided for keynote speeches.

Additionally, establishing support systems to help organizing members communicate in English is one of my top priorities (currently in planning).

I'm also exploring opportunities for pre-event networking. Local community hybrid events are scheduled for August 27th and September 24th.

## First Regional Hosting and Theme

This is the first time PyCon JP is held outside Tokyo. Hiroshima is a symbolic place where different backgrounds meet and blend together, embodying our theme "Pieces of Python, Coming Together." The regional hosting creates an intimate, welcoming atmosphere that fosters quality dialogue and connections.

## Hiroshima's Appeal (Enjoyable Beyond the Conference)

Rich historical and cultural depth, culinary culture including okonomiyaki, fresh oysters, and sake, access to Miyajima Island (one of Japan's three scenic views). Experience authentic "omotenashi" hospitality in a relaxed urban setting.

## Closing

[PyCon JP 2025](https://2025.pycon.jp/) is more than a technical event. It's an opportunity to experience Japanese Python community culture, build relationships across borders and languages, and help shape this milestone first regional hosting. Please don't hesitate to reach out when you need help.

Your journey to Hiroshima begins with one decision. Take that step today.
