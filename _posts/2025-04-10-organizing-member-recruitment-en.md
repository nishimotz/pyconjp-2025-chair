This is a personal daily report by PyCon JP 2025 Chair [@nishimotz](https://d.nishimotz.com/aboutme).

## Call for PyCon JP 2025 Organizing Members!

[PyCon JP 2025](https://2025.pycon.jp/), Japan's largest conference on the Python programming language, will be held at the Hiroshima International Conference Center on September 26-27. We are also planning to hold the traditional development sprints on September 28.

We are currently looking for "Organizing Members" to help us create PyCon JP 2025 together.
We call our members "Organizing Members" rather than just staff because we want to emphasize the spirit of being partners who build the event together.

Preparations for the conference are already underway, but we still don't have enough organizing members.
We welcome participation from many people interested in event management, regardless of Python experience, location, or available time! (See FAQ for details)

Organizing members work in the following teams:

- **Chair Team**: Responsible for overall coordination and budget management
- **Program Team**: Responsible for speaker selection and schedule management
- **Venue Team**: Responsible for venue setup and day-of operations
- **Public Relations Team**: Responsible for website and social media communications
- **Sponsor Team**: Responsible for coordination with sponsoring companies
- **Attendee Management Team**: Responsible for ticket sales and attendee support

## How to Become an Organizing Member

To become an organizing member, please follow these steps:

1. Register through the [Organizing Member Application Form](https://forms.gle/7irqYKhZVj7AY7LfA)
2. Follow the instructions in the email you receive to join Slack

## Message

PyCon JP 2025 aims to leverage the new stage of Hiroshima to deepen connections with new attendee segments by collaborating with the local community. For example, we want to deliver the appeal of Python to diverse people such as students and engineers from neighboring regions, and those visiting for tourism.

We particularly encourage residents of Hiroshima and neighboring areas to take this opportunity to apply.

Many major IT conferences have traditionally been held in Tokyo, which may have deterred some people or made them feel the barrier to entry was high.

We want such individuals to experience the valuable opportunity of participating in community-focused event management, utilizing local perspectives and networks.

Preparations will proceed in various forms, including online and asynchronous formats, as well as hybrid and offline work based in both Tokyo and Hiroshima.

Being involved behind the scenes as an organizing member offers deep experiences and a sense of accomplishment that regular attendees cannot gain. (Please also see the FAQ regarding how we work and our support system)

We look forward to creating PyCon JP 2025 together with you.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the Chair ([@nishimotz](https://d.nishimotz.com/aboutme)).

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: How much time commitment is required?**

A: The time commitment varies depending on the team and the phase of preparation, but participation is possible starting from a few hours per week. We strive to accommodate your pace so you can contribute comfortably. Involvement for specific periods or tasks only is also welcome!

**Q: Is Python knowledge really necessary?**

A: No, it's not required! PyCon JP is a conference about the Python programming language, but various skills such as event management, design, public relations, and communication are valuable. Of course, those knowledgeable about Python are also very welcome!

We are also considering Python study sessions for organizing members. People who want to learn Python are welcome too.

**Q: What happens after I register through the application form?**

A: After you fill out the form, the Chair will send you an invitation email to Slack. Once you join Slack, let's discuss the teams and activities you are interested in with the Chair. Communication is primarily done via Slack (chat), but if you prefer to talk directly, we can arrange an online meeting (1-on-1) with the Chair.

**Q: Are there any costs to become an organizing member? What about conference admission fees and travel expenses?**

A: There is no cost associated with the organizing member activities themselves. Regarding the conference admission fee, we want to reduce the burden for organizing members (this is not yet confirmed).

We plan to expand our travel support program for travel and accommodation expenses to the venue. However, please note that the budget is limited, so we may not be able to meet all requests. Also, we do not necessarily give preferential treatment for travel assistance to organizing members residing overseas.

**Q: Which team can I join?**

A: You can choose a team that matches your interests and skills through discussions in meetings or on Slack.

**Q: My Japanese language skills are limited.**

A: Please don't worry! In addition to machine translation support during online meetings, we will provide as much support as possible, such as bilingual documentation and collaboration with members who can communicate in English.

English communication and checks from a non-Japanese speaker's perspective are very important to us. We sincerely welcome your contributions in these areas.

**Q: Where do the main activities take place?**

A: Basic communication happens online (mainly Slack). We plan to have regular hybrid (online/offline) work days (general meetings) and organizing member retreats in the future. Details will be announced once decided. Meetings for specific teams or tasks are scheduled by the relevant members.

**Q: Are there regular Python-related study groups in Hiroshima?**

A: Yes, [Sugoi Hiroshima with Python](https://pycon-hiroshima.connpass.com/event/) is held hybrid-style every month on the last Wednesday evening from 19:00. The Chair also reports on PyCon JP preparation status monthly. Feel free to join!
