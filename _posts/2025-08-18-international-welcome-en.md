This is Chair Nishimoto. 39 days until the conference, day 86 of the 100-day challenge.

## A Personal Message from the Chair

First and foremost, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to all international attendees who have decided to come to Japan, to Hiroshima, for PyCon JP 2025. Thank you so much for making the commitment to join us from afar.

I also want to extend my deep appreciation to all international speakers who submitted proposals. Your knowledge and experience will enrich our conference immeasurably.

However, as Chair, I must honestly apologize for something. Due to our organizational shortcomings in handling VISA invitation letter processing and travel grant procedures, we have caused worry and inconvenience to many of you. I am truly sorry.

I have been working with all teams involved, doing my absolute best as Chair to address these issues. If you feel that our response has not been timely enough, or if you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us. I personally review all inquiries from international attendees and strive to provide the most prompt response possible.

## First Time? Welcome to PyCon JP 2025 - Embracing International Attendees

Are you hesitating about joining PyCon JP 2025? You might be feeling concerns like "it's too far away," "I don't speak Japanese," or "will I fit in?"

Let me share why this year's PyCon JP will be an especially welcoming place for international attendees.

## Historic First Regional Hosting

This marks PyCon JP's first-ever hosting outside Tokyo. We chose Hiroshima not just for accessibility, but as a place where different worlds converge - embodying our theme "pieces of python, coming together."

Regional hosting allows us to create a more intimate and welcoming atmosphere than our traditional Tokyo venues. You'll find it easier to connect not only with Japanese attendees but also with fellow international participants in this more relaxed environment.

## What We're Preparing for You

### Language Support
- Simultaneous interpretation will be provided for keynote speeches
- English support teams will be on-site
- Many Japanese attendees are excited to engage in English conversations

### Financial and Practical Support
- Travel grant program for remote attendees currently being processed
- Visa invitation letters available when needed
- PayPal payment options to avoid international credit card issues
- Early bird tickets still available (fewer than 40 remaining, expected to sell out in August)
- Special discount tickets for students and those under 25

### Cultural Bridging
- Pre-event networking through online meetups
- EuroPython Report Session on August 26th (online participation available)
- Community bonding with local Python groups

## What Makes Hiroshima Special

### Beyond the Conference
- Rich historical significance and cultural depth
- World-famous cuisine: okonomiyaki, fresh oysters, premium sake
- Easy access to Miyajima Island (one of Japan's three scenic views)
- Authentic Japanese hospitality, different from Tokyo's fast pace

### Intimate Community Experience
- Smaller scale allows for quality over quantity conversations
- Local organizing team members genuinely excited to welcome international attendees
- Direct experience of Japanese "omotenashi" (hospitality) culture

## From the Chair's Perspective

Having attended overseas conferences myself, I understand the challenges you face:
- Anxiety about fitting into different cultures
- Concerns about language barriers and communication
- Considerations about travel arrangements and costs

But I also know the value of stepping outside your comfort zone. Some of my most meaningful professional relationships and insights came from overseas conferences where I initially felt out of place.

## A Bigger Picture

This isn't just a technical conference. It's an opportunity to:
- Experience Japanese Python community culture firsthand
- Build lasting relationships across cultural boundaries  
- Contribute to PyCon JP's true internationalization
- Be part of our historic first regional hosting

Your participation doesn't just add value to our conference - it transforms it.

As Chair, I promise that every international attendee will be welcomed and valued. Whether you encounter payment issues or cultural questions, please reach out directly.

We're not just inviting you to a conference. We're inviting you to help us make history as PyCon JP's first truly regional and internationally welcoming event.

Your journey to Hiroshima begins with just one decision. Make that decision today.
