Hello, this is Nishimotz, the Chair of PyCon JP 2025.

PyCon JP 2025 will be held at Hiroshima International Conference Center from September 26-28, 2025 (the final day is for development sprints). PyCon JP is Japan's largest Python community event, an international nonprofit conference organized primarily by Python community members.

Today I want to explain PyCon JP 2025's **Early Bird Tickets**.

*This post is based on my [note article "What is an Early Bird Ticket?"](https://note.com/24motz/n/n8db01d93006f) from July 25, part of my #100-day challenge.*

## What Does "Early Bird" Mean?

"Early Bird" literally refers to birds that wake up early. This comes from the English proverb "The early bird catches the worm," which is equivalent to the Japanese saying "早起きは三文の徳" (early rising brings small benefits).

From this proverb, the term "early bird" has come to mean "early purchase discounts" in events and services. Our PyCon JP 2025 Early Bird tickets offer exactly that—conference participation at a more affordable price than regular tickets.

## Why Do We Offer Early Bird Tickets?

You might wonder, "Why intentionally offer cheaper tickets?" There are several important reasons behind this from our organizing team's perspective:

### Gratitude to Our Enthusiastic Community

We want to express our appreciation to community members who consistently care about PyCon JP and eagerly commit to attending from the early announcement stages. The discounted pricing is our way of showing tangible gratitude to these dedicated participants.

### Early Gauge of Event Scale

Early Bird ticket sales help us understand "how many people have strong interest in PyCon JP 2025" at an early stage. This allows us to improve the accuracy of our planning—from venue layout and equipment needs to merchandise orders—leading to smoother, higher-quality conference management.

Your early action becomes a force that makes the conference better for everyone.

## Early Bird vs. Personal Tickets: Only Price Differs

**There is absolutely no difference in experience or benefits between Early Bird and Personal tickets!** The content, access, and privileges are identical.

I'm aware that some generous community members choose to purchase Personal tickets even when Early Bird tickets are available, wanting to contribute more to support our operations. We deeply appreciate this generosity.

## Important Message for Proposal Submitters

I have a crucial message for everyone who submitted wonderful presentation proposals:

PyCon JP is an event created together by everyone—speakers, attendees, staff, and sponsors—all as "community members." Based on this philosophy of "everyone is both a participant and contributor," we want to build sustainable operations supported by our entire community for the future.

Therefore, PyCon JP 2025 operates under these principles:

1. **Speakers also purchase tickets**: We ask speakers to purchase conference tickets like all other attendees (we don't provide speaker-only free tickets)
2. **No refunds based on proposal results**: Regardless of whether proposals are accepted or rejected, we generally don't offer refunds for purchased tickets

### Our Sincere Apology

We must apologize for a scheduling issue: we've started ticket sales before announcing proposal acceptance results.

We fully understand that acceptance results are crucial for your participation decisions. Your desire to wait for results before purchasing tickets is completely reasonable, and we sincerely apologize for this challenging timeline.

### Our Strong Commitment

Despite these difficult conditions, our organizing team has one powerful wish: regardless of presentation acceptance or rejection, we want to create such an outstanding conference that you'll think, "I want to join the PyCon JP 2025 celebration as early as possible!" and "I genuinely want to enjoy connecting with the Python community in Hiroshima as a participant!"

These Early Bird tickets represent our heartfelt gratitude to those who believe in PyCon JP's value itself and enthusiastically declare "I'm coming to Hiroshima!"

## Did You Know About Hiroshima's Prefectural Bird?

Let me share some bird trivia related to Early Bird tickets.

Hiroshima Prefecture's official bird is the **"Abi" (Common Loon)**, a migratory bird that travels from northern seas to the Seto Inland Sea every winter.

Historically, Hiroshima's waters featured traditional "Abi fishing" where these birds cooperated with humans. This fishing method offers profound insights for us in technology:

1. **Abi flocks** use their sharp diving abilities to drive small fish (sand lance) toward the surface
2. **Larger fish** (sea bream, sea bass) gather to feed on these small fish  
3. **Experienced fishermen** carefully observe the Abi flocks' movements, quietly position their boats where fish schools form
4. **Traditional hand-line fishing** precisely catches the fish the Abi have corralled

This relationship reminds me of **human-AI collaboration**:

- **Abi's "corralling"** = AI's role: AI rapidly analyzes vast amounts of data humans can't handle, discovering valuable patterns and trends (= fish schools)
- **Fishermen's "catching"** = Human role: Based on AI-provided insights, humans create innovative ideas and develop final business strategies, generating significant value (= catch)

Each utilizing their strengths to achieve results neither could accomplish alone—this hints at future ways of working. I'm excited thinking about it!

At PyCon JP 2025, we're sure to see stimulating discussions where cutting-edge technology intersects with human wisdom.
