## Call for Proposals Open

[PyCon JP 2025](https://2025.pycon.jp/) will be held at the Hiroshima International Conference Center from September 26 to 28 (the last day is development sprints), and we're currently calling for proposals!

Why not try presenting at PyCon JP, Python's conference?

The deadline is June 29.

## What is a Poster Presentation?

PyCon JP 2025 proposals have three types of formats:
- Talk (30 minutes)
- Poster  
- Community Poster

Did anyone think "What's a poster?"

A poster presentation is a style of presentation where you summarize what you want to present on a large paper (poster) and introduce it in front of the poster while talking with attendees.

- Posters are lined up in a corner of the venue
- Presenters directly explain to people who come to listen
- Attendees can freely move around the venue

I'll leave the detailed explanation of the poster format at PyCon JP 2025 to the organizing members.
Here, once again, as someone with past poster presentation experience, I'll talk about what it's like.

## Core Time

I don't know the official term, but there's a designated time period where "presenters must be in front of their poster during this time."
Let's call it core time here.
It's a time set in advance by the organizers so attendees can easily ask questions.
Attendees can freely view posters outside of core time, but presenters need to be in front of their poster during core time.

## What Kind of People Are Suited for Poster Presentations?

### People Who Want to Present for the First Time

It's more casual than oral presentations using slides, and you can explain at your own pace.
It's perfect for your "presentation debut."

### People Who Want to Show or Let Others Experience Something

Within the space constraints, you can also demonstrate using tablets or PCs next to the poster.
"I'm an artist, but I create art with Python.
Please take a look."
I saw such poster presentations at this year's PyCon US.
It's not just a festival for engineers.

### People Working Hard in Specialized Fields

Niche topics are very welcome.
It's a place where you can meet colleagues with the same interests.
If you're a researcher or student, haven't you done poster presentations at conferences, within your organization, or at your university?
If that's related to Python, it's your chance!
You might be able to use that poster as-is!

Let's broaden the listeners' world by showing how people in such fields use Python.
You might find unexpected colleagues.
Someone might approach you saying they used to do something similar.

### People Who Want to Convey to International Participants

If you create a poster with English explanations, it reaches more people.
Even if you're worried about speaking English, if you translate in advance with AI, you can get by just reading the poster on the day!
Whatever your English level, we're colleagues involved with Python.
Your enthusiasm will surely come across.
There are smartphone translation apps too.
Let's communicate with people gathered from around the world (in Hiroshima)!

## Also Recommended for Question Asker Debuts!

When you participate in a conference as an attendee and think something was interesting or want to hear more details, with talks, it's nerve-wracking to ask the speaker questions through a microphone.
Plus, session Q&A ends in a flash.
With posters, you can naturally stop by and say "Hello" and start a conversation.
"What's this?"
"How did you make it?"
You can enjoy conversation without being formal.
Let's also enjoy English conversations with international poster presenters!

## Poster Presentations at PyCon US

Guido van Rossum, Python's creator, apparently goes around looking at poster presentations at PyCon US every year.
In 2025, I also saw Guido at the poster venue.
You might think "posters are supporting actors?" but they're information sharing venues valued at PyCons worldwide.

## My Experience

Poster presentation is a format I especially recommend for people who feel "I'm not good at speaking" or "I lack confidence."
A poster isn't just paper.
Your thoughts become an "entrance" that connects people to people.

I did poster presentations several times with my specialty topic "Japanese support for screen reader NVDA."
I held a laptop while standing and explained while doing demos making it speak.
I even got a speaker T-shirt, and had this strange realization that "ah, I'm being treated properly as a presenter."
Eventually people started saying "ah, you're presenting again this year."
Though I didn't continue.

Well, let me introduce the third format, community posters, in a separate article.

## Both Speakers and Sponsors Wanted

**PyCon JP 2025 is calling for both proposals (presenters) and sponsors!**
