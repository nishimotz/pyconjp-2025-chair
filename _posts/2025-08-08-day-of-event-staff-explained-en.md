Hello, this is Nishimotz, the Chair of PyCon JP 2025.

PyCon JP 2025 will be held at Hiroshima International Conference Center from September 26-28, 2025 (the final day is for development sprints). PyCon JP is Japan's largest Python community event, an international nonprofit conference organized primarily by Python community members.

This is day 66 of my note continuous posting #100-day challenge as the chair.

**"Are you recruiting volunteer staff who will only help on the day of the event?"**

I sometimes receive this question. While it's not a final decision, **my current answer is "NO."**

But instead of that, I have some shocking news to share with everyone.

*This post is based on my [note article "Will You Recruit Day-of-Event Staff?"](https://note.com/24motz/n/n3bbc8735aabf) from July 29, part of my #100-day challenge.*

## You Can Still Become an Organizing Member Even Now!

**We haven't finished recruiting organizing members yet.**

**[PyCon JP 2025 Organizing Member Application Form](https://forms.gle/7irqYKhZVj7AY7LfA)**

We distinguish between the terms "staff" and "organizing members."

- **Staff**: We use this term for business contractors and vendors who enter the venue
- **Organizing Members**: Volunteers who plan and operate the event together with me

Even now, two weeks after we started ticket sales, we continue recruiting partners who will help create this festival with us.

**No special skills or experience are required.** All you need is the desire to "support the Python community" and "make the Hiroshima event successful."

## „ÄêWe're Recruiting Network Specialists„Äë

I've been asked by the venue team to let everyone know that **we're recruiting network specialists**. Apparently, we're at a critical point where having someone or not will determine what we can accomplish.

Actually, if I weren't the chair, this would be an opportunity for me to get hands-on with routers...

## PyCon JP's "Participation Philosophy"

"Wait, if I become an organizing member instead of buying a ticket, can I participate for free?"

Some people might think this way. Let me explain our customs here.

I'm sometimes asked about this, but **my work as chair is unpaid**. Moreover, at PyCon JP, all organizing members, including myself as chair, **pay participation fees to attend the conference**.

While it's not an explicit rule, speakers, participants, and organizing members are all equal partners who enjoy this event and support each other. As an expression of this philosophy, **everyone shares the costs of hosting the event**.

We're following this policy this year as well.

Organizing member tickets have different prices from general participation fees, but **only organizing members can purchase them** (purchases by non-organizing members will be invalidated).

## Why Don't We Recruit Day-of-Event Volunteers?

### **ü§ù Community Partnership Philosophy**
Rather than seeking temporary help, we believe in **building lasting partnerships** with people who want to be involved in the entire journey of creating PyCon JP 2025.

### **üìà Shared Ownership Experience**
When you're involved from planning through execution, you develop **genuine ownership** of the event's success and can contribute more meaningfully to problem-solving and innovation.

### **üéØ Consistent Quality Standards**
Having **committed organizing members** who understand our values, processes, and goals ensures consistent quality throughout all aspects of the event.

### **üå± Community Growth Focus**
