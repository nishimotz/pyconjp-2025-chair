Hello! I'm Nishimotz, Chair of [PyCon JP 2025](https://2025.pycon.jp/).
This note is day 37 of my [#100-day challenge](https://note.com/hashtag/100%E6%97%A5%E3%83%81%E3%83%A3%E3%83%AC%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B8).

PyCon JP 2025 will be held at the Hiroshima International Conference Center from September 26 (Fri) to 28 (Sun), 2025. Two days of conference, and the last day will be development sprints.

Why not plan a trip to slowly enjoy Hiroshima in conjunction with this event where you can interact with Python community members from all over the country and the world?
In this article, I'll introduce a travel plan I created on my own, centered around PyCon JP 2025.
I hope others will write detailed information about each of these!

## Summary

The theme of PyCon JP 2025 is "Gather Python Pieces."
That includes not just technology and knowledge, but all the "pieces" of people you meet in Hiroshima, experiences, and moments that remain in your heart.
In addition to learning and meeting people, experience Hiroshima's autumn with all five senses.
Please plan your own week!

Note: I know about some events and facilities but haven't been to them myself.
Please check official websites to confirm whether the dates listed in this plan are business days (visiting days, event days).
Information about PyCon JP 2025 tickets and distant travel support is being prepared.
Please wait for announcements on the official website. [https://note.com/24motz/n/n8828bcad687a](https://note.com/24motz/n/n8828bcad687a)
