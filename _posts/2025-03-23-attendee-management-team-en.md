## Goals for 2025

### Ticket Types and Pricing

In 2024, we introduced U25 tickets and other initiatives.

For 2025, we aim to set ticket types and prices that will encourage more people to participate.

The chair's current preference is to sell official party tickets separately from conference tickets to make the conference tickets more affordable.

The following are the chair's ideas. The team is welcome to decide whether to adopt them:

- Special tickets for Hiroshima residents
- Free tickets for sponsor booth access only
- Discounted tickets for attending only Day 1 or Day 2
- We may also try other new initiatives that haven't been done before

### Team Collaboration

The following tasks require coordination with other teams:

- Ticket prices and quantities (including the ticket for organizing members) will be determined in coordination with the Chair Team (budget, accounting). The chair wants to reduce the burden on organizing members.
- The number of party tickets will be determined based on venue constraints.
- Development sprints and tutorial implementation will be coordinated with the Program Team.
- Novelties, name badges, and other materials will use designs created by the PR Team.
- Blog and social media announcements will be coordinated with the PR Team.
- We will support tasks (mainly for the Venue Team) that require attendee count information.

### Smooth and Fair Operations

- It can be challenging to link accounts across teams and systems for talk submissions (CFP), ticket purchases, payments, travel support, invitation letters, and potentially sponsor and organizing member management. We want to find ways to provide services and respond to inquiries smoothly.
- Please actively consider technologies, including those introduced in 2024, to streamline on-site registration.
- It is desirable to clearly define discount eligibility criteria in advance and ensure that verifications can be carried out reliably.
- If necessary, we will consider recruiting staff who will only be active the day before or on the day of the event.
- The Attendee Management Team has a principle that it does not handle money for ticket sales.

## Upcoming Schedule

- April: Determination of ticket types and pricing
