# First Time in Japan? You're Welcome at PyCon JP 2025

39 days until the conference, Day 86 of the 100-day challenge.

## Why This PyCon JP is Special for International Visitors

Are you hesitating to attend PyCon JP 2025? Maybe you're thinking "It's too far," "I don't speak Japanese," or "Will I fit in?"

Let me tell you why this year's PyCon JP is particularly welcoming for international participants.

## Historic First: PyCon JP Goes Regional

This is the first time in PyCon JP's history that we're hosting outside Tokyo. We chose Hiroshima not just for its accessibility, but for what it represents: a place where different worlds come together, just like our theme "pieces of python, coming together."

This regional hosting creates a more intimate atmosphere than our usual Tokyo events. You'll find it easier to connect with both Japanese and international participants in a more relaxed, welcoming environment.

## We've Prepared for You

## What Makes Hiroshima Special

### Beyond the Conference
- Rich historical significance and cultural depth
- World-renowned cuisine: okonomiyaki, fresh oysters, premium sake
- Easy access to Miyajima (one of Japan's three scenic views)
- Authentic Japanese hospitality without the Tokyo rush

### Intimate Community Experience
- Smaller scale means quality conversations over quantity
- Local organizing team members who are genuinely excited to welcome international visitors
- Opportunity to experience Japanese "omotenashi" (hospitality culture) firsthand

## From the Chair's Perspective

Having attended international conferences myself, I understand the challenges you face:
- The uncertainty about fitting into a different culture
- Language barriers and communication concerns  
- Travel logistics and expense considerations

But I also know the incredible value of stepping out of your comfort zone. Some of my most meaningful professional relationships and insights came from international conferences where I initially felt out of place.

## Pre-Conference Connections

Don't wait until September to start connecting:
- Join our international Slack channels
- Attend the EuroPython Report Session (August 26)
- Connect with other overseas participants through our social media
- Reach out directly if you have any concerns or questions

## The Bigger Picture

This isn't just another tech conference. It's a chance to:
- Experience Japanese Python community culture firsthand
- Build lasting connections across cultural boundaries
- Contribute to making PyCon JP truly international
- Be part of a historic first regional hosting

Your presence doesn't just add to our conference—it transforms it.

## Don't Wait—Act Now

Early bird tickets are running out fast (under 40 remaining). If you're on the fence, secure your spot first and plan the details later. 

The official party on September 26th evening is perfect for continued networking (separate ticket required, early bird pricing until August 31).

## Personal Message

As chair, I'm committed to ensuring every international participant feels welcomed and valued. If you encounter any difficulties—from payment issues to cultural questions—please don't hesitate to reach out directly.

We're not just inviting you to attend our conference. We're inviting you to help us make history as PyCon JP's first truly regional, internationally welcoming event.

Your journey to Hiroshima starts with a single decision. Make it today.
