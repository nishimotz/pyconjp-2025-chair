This is my eleventh daily report from the Chair of PyCon JP 2025.

## Background

PyCon JP has experience welcoming international speakers, providing interpretation services, and including overseas organizing members. However, we acknowledge that communication between international and Japan-based organizing members has not always been optimal, and we haven't always been able to provide sufficient opportunities for international members to fully contribute.

As organizing members, there are certain responsibilities and our Code of Conduct that need to be understood. Additionally, we need to discuss practical matters such as legal procedures for entering Japan and financial considerations.

As the Conference Chair for PyCon JP 2025, I believe it's essential to have a dedicated session to address these important aspects of international collaboration.

## A Note of Gratitude

We've received three enthusiastic applications from potential international organizing members, even before we had fully prepared our international recruitment process. We are deeply grateful for your interest and proactive approach. Your applications demonstrate a strong desire to contribute to PyCon JP 2025, and this has encouraged us to accelerate our plans for international collaboration.
