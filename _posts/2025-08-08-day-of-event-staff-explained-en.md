Hello, this is Nishimotz, the Chair of PyCon JP 2025.

PyCon JP 2025 will be held at Hiroshima International Conference Center from September 26-28, 2025 (the final day is for development sprints). PyCon JP is Japan's largest Python community event, an international nonprofit conference organized primarily by Python community members.

This is day 66 of my note continuous posting #100-day challenge as the chair.

**"Are you recruiting volunteer staff who will only help on the day of the event?"**

I sometimes receive this question. While it's not a final decision, **my current answer is "NO."**

But instead of that, I have some **shocking news** to share with everyone.

*This post is based on my [note article "Will You Recruit Day-of-Event Staff?"](https://note.com/24motz/n/n3bbc8735aabf) from July 29, part of my #100-day challenge.*

## You Can Still Become an Organizing Member Even Now!

**We haven't finished recruiting organizing members yet.**

## Understanding Our Terminology

We distinguish between the terms **"staff"** and **"organizing members."**

- **Staff**: We use this term for business contractors and vendors who enter the venue
- **Organizing Members**: Volunteers who plan and operate the event together with me

Even now, **two weeks after we started ticket sales**, we continue recruiting partners who will help create this festival with us.

**No special skills or experience are required.** All you need is the desire to **"support the Python community"** and **"make the Hiroshima event successful."**

If you want to know what kind of work is involved, please check this out: [Dialogue with Hiroshima-based Organizing Members](https://note.com/24motz/n/n42e32194926e).

## „ÄêUrgent: We're Recruiting Network Specialists„Äë

I've been asked by the venue team to let everyone know that **we're recruiting network specialists**. Apparently, we're at a critical point where having someone or not will determine what we can accomplish.

Actually, if I weren't the chair, this would be an opportunity for me to get hands-on with routers...

## PyCon JP's "Participation Philosophy"

**"Wait, if I become an organizing member instead of buying a ticket, can I participate for free?"**

Some people might think this way. Let me explain our customs here.

I'm sometimes asked about this, but **my work as chair is unpaid**. Moreover, at PyCon JP, **all organizing members, including myself as chair, pay participation fees to attend the conference**.

While it's not an explicit rule, **speakers, participants, and organizing members are all equal partners** who enjoy this event and support each other. As an expression of this philosophy, **everyone shares the costs of hosting the event** by contributing a little bit each.

We're following this policy this year as well.

**Organizing member tickets have different prices from general participation fees, but only organizing members can purchase them** (purchases by non-organizing members will be invalidated).

## Why Don't We Meet First?

**"I understand, but applying directly feels like a high hurdle..."**  
**"I'd like to know more about what kind of people are involved"**

If you feel this way, we have a **perfect opportunity** for you.

On **July 30 (Wednesday), the commemorative 100th meeting of "Sugoi Hiroshima with Python"** will be held in Hiroshima City.

**Event Details:**
- **Name**: Sugoi Hiroshima with Python Á¨¨100Âõû (100th Meeting)
- **Date**: July 30, 2025, 7:00 PM
- **Location**: Near Hiroshima Station  
- **Format**: Hybrid event (online participation welcome)
- **Registration**: [Connpass Event Page](https://pycon-hiroshima.connpass.com/event/360595/)

This is a **"casual" study group** where Hiroshima's Python community gathers. And **I, the PyCon JP 2025 chair, will also be participating**.

**You're very welcome to ask questions directly about PyCon JP organizing activities.** Even if you just want to experience the atmosphere of Hiroshima's Python community, that's perfectly fine. **People who are undecided about buying general tickets are also welcome.**

Please feel free to drop by casually. Since it's a hybrid event, **online participants are very welcome too!**
