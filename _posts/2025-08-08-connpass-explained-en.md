I'm Nishimotz, Chair of PyCon JP 2025.
This note is day 43 of my [#100-day challenge](https://note.com/hashtag/100%E6%97%A5%E3%83%81%E3%83%A3%E3%83%AC%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B8).

PyCon JP 2025 will be held on September 26-27 in Hiroshima. September 28 will be the development sprint.
We are currently recruiting sponsors.
Registration will open in July. [https://2025.pycon.jp/](https://2025.pycon.jp/)

You see the PyCon JP official site and decide to participate.
When you go to the registration page, you naturally encounter the "connpass" logo. "What is this?" "Why do I have to use this?" If you're new to this, it's natural to think that way. [https://connpass.com/](https://connpass.com/)

Today, before explaining the specific registration process, let me first explain what this "connpass" service is and what it means to our IT community, especially PyCon JP.

## A "Square" for IT Study Groups

connpass is a web service that handles the entire flow of finding, registering for, and participating in IT study groups and conferences. Since appearing in 2011, it has continued to support Japan's IT study group culture and can be called a "veteran" in this field.
Various technical events, large and small, gather and are held in this "square" every day.
When you access connpass, it's like stepping into this vibrant square and exploring interesting events. Here's an article I'd like to introduce: ["Hearing about connpass history"](https://dotstud.io/blog/connpass-n0bisuke-interview-vol2/).

## A "Comrade-in-Arms" That Grew with PyCon JP

Among the various event services available, why does PyCon JP 2025 use connpass?
It's because connpass has grown together with PyCon JP as what we can call a "comrade-in-arms."
Large-scale conferences like PyCon JP take on new challenges every year.
connpass supports these challenges with technology.
For example, at [PyCon JP 2024](https://2024.pycon.jp/), we utilized new features like QR code payments for smooth registration and voucher functionality for sponsors and invitees to waive participation fees.
connpass continues to evolve to meet PyCon JP's "We want to do this!" requests.
This service is apparently developed in Python (Django).
People involved in the service often give talks about development and operations at PyCon JP and various PyCon mini events around Japan, so in that sense, it's a familiar presence for Python engineers.

## My Experience as an Event Organizer

I think some people have used connpass to organize small study groups, but not many have used it to collect participation fees.
I have experience organizing an event called "PyCon mini Hiroshima" several times in Hiroshima. [https://pycon-hiroshima.connpass.com/event/139166/](https://pycon-hiroshima.connpass.com/event/139166/)

I used the payment functionality myself at that time.
I learned that connpass **doesn't charge platform fees** from us event organizers. [https://help.connpass.com/organizers/paid-event-edit](https://help.connpass.com/organizers/paid-event-edit)

The participation fees I collected from participants (as an event organizer) were received in full, minus only the fees from the payment service behind connpass (PayPal).
I don't really understand how this kind of operation is possible, but I think it's something to be grateful for.

## A Place Where Your "Learning Journey" is Recorded

For you as a participant, connpass also becomes like a "bookshelf" that records your growth.
Your history of past event participation remains on your profile, and when you look back, you can feel your learning journey: "Ah, I was excited about this technology a year ago."
Also, it has social networking features, so you can learn about events that friends are organizing or participating in.
Meeting events and connecting with people.
Connecting with people leads to discovering more events.
It's convenient that information keeps coming to you without actively searching. [https://help.connpass.com/basic/setting_sns](https://help.connpass.com/basic/setting_sns)

## Conference Feature

connpass recently launched a conference feature. [https://connpass.com/feature/conference/](https://connpass.com/feature/conference/)

## PyCon JP 2025 is Held in Hiroshima

PyCon JP 2025 is held in Hiroshima. (I wrote that again)

The official site will make various announcements for participants, but I also plan to write various things from a personal standpoint (58 days left). [https://note.com/24motz/n/nf7602be7df5b](https://note.com/24motz/n/nf7602be7df5b)
