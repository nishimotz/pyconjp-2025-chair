Hello, this is Nishimotz, the Chair of PyCon JP 2025.

PyCon JP 2025 will be held on September 26-27 in Hiroshima, with development sprints on September 28. We're currently recruiting sponsors, and participant registration will begin in July.

When you visit the PyCon JP official website and decide to participate, you'll naturally encounter the "connpass" logo on the registration page. "What is this?" "Why do we need to use this?" If you're new to the Japanese tech scene, these questions are completely natural.

Today, before we dive into the specific registration process, let me explain what "connpass" is and what it means to Japan's IT community, especially PyCon JP.

*This post is based on my [note article "What is connpass?"](https://note.com/24motz/n/n662c94e30e5c) from July 6, part of my #100-day challenge.*

## A "Public Square" for IT Study Groups

**connpass** is a web service that handles the entire flow of finding, registering for, and participating in IT study groups and conferences. Since its launch in 2011, it has continuously supported Japan's IT study group culture and can be considered a "veteran" in this field.

Various technical events, large and small, gather and are held in this "public square" every day. When you access connpass, it's like stepping into this vibrant square and exploring interesting events.

For more background, there's an interesting article titled ["connpass History Interview"](https://dotstud.io/blog/connpass-n0bisuke-interview-vol2/) that provides deeper insights into its development.

## A "Comrade-in-Arms" That Grew with PyCon JP

Among many event services available, why does PyCon JP 2025 use connpass? **It's because connpass has grown alongside PyCon JP as what we might call a "comrade-in-arms."**

Large-scale conferences like PyCon JP take on new challenges every year. connpass has supported these challenges with technology. For example, at PyCon JP 2024, we utilized new features like:

- **QR code payments** for smoother registration
- **Voucher functionality** to waive participation fees for sponsors and invitees
- **Custom registration workflows** tailored to conference needs

connpass continues to evolve to meet PyCon JP's "We want to do this!" requests.

### Built with Python, By Pythonistas

Interestingly, **connpass itself is developed using Python (Django)**. People involved with the service often speak about development and operations at PyCon JP and regional PyCon mini events, making it a familiar presence for Python engineers in this sense as well.

## My Experience as an Event Organizer

Many people may have used connpass to organize small study groups, but fewer have used it to collect participation fees. I have experience organizing several "PyCon mini Hiroshima" events in Hiroshima.

When I used the payment functionality, **I learned that connpass doesn't charge platform usage fees to event organizers**. The participation fees I collected from attendees were transferred to me in full, minus only the payment service (PayPal) processing fees behind connpass.

I don't fully understand how they sustain this business model, but I'm grateful for it.

## Your "Learning Journey" Archive

For participants, **connpass also serves as a "bookshelf" that records your growth**. Your past event participation history remains in your profile, and when you look back, you can feel the trajectory of your learning: "Oh, I was fascinated by this technology a year ago."

### Social Discovery Features

connpass also offers social integration features, allowing you to discover events that friends have organized or attended. **Events help you meet people. Meeting people helps you discover more events.** Even without actively searching, information flows to you naturally‚Äîvery convenient!
