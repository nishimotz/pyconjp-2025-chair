This is my tenth daily report, where I share my personal insights and experiences as both a passionate Python enthusiast and the Chair of PyCon JP 2025.

[PyCon JP 2025](https://2025.pycon.jp/) will be held on September 26-27 at the Hiroshima International Conference Center.

[We are currently recruiting organizing members.](https://forms.gle/7irqYKhZVj7AY7LfA)

We accept applications for organizing members from outside of Japan, but please apply with the understanding that travel grants cannot be guaranteed. (changed on 2025-02-26)

I am delighted to hear that many people said, "I will go to Hiroshima," or "I wasn't planning to go to Hiroshima, but now I want to."

## Current activities of PyCon JP 2025 organizing members

We have conducted group work using an online whiteboard with the PyCon JP 2025 organizing members.

We shared our thoughts about each member's activities and deepened our understanding of stakeholders related to PyCon JP 2025.

## Overview of the event

- Date: September 26-27, 2025
- Venue: Hiroshima International Conference Center (in Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park)

## About the venue

The venue is reserved, but the specific use plan is an important action item to be decided in March.

### Venue capacity

- Main Hall: 1500 people
- International Conference Hall: 600 people
- Large Conference Room, Medium Conference Room, Small Conference Room: 700 people, 300 people, 200 people or more

## From concept to plan

We aim to fully utilize the venue's capacity, so we are making a plan by reviewing the concept.

This discussion is now in full swing.

- Understand how Python is learned and used now, beyond the history of PyCon JP
- At the same time, review the history of PyCon JP

Reviewing the [history of PyCon JP](https://www.pycon.jp/organizer/) reminds me that I have been involved in Python and PyCon JP as "my own" history.

## My relationship with PyCon JP

### Initial activities (2011-2015)

I was trying to learn Python more deeply to help translate the open-source screen reader [NVDA (Non Visual Desktop Access)](https://www.nvaccess.org/) into Japanese.

- January 2011: Participated in PyCon mini JP, gave a talk about the Japanese translation of NVDA (Non Visual Desktop Access)
- 2012: Held a kick-off event for the full Japanese translation of NVDA at a PyCon JP-affiliated [Workshop](https://workshop.nvda.jp/)
  - Invited Michael Curran, a developer of NVDA, from Australia
  - [Also gave a lightning talk (YouTube recording)](https://www.youtube.com/live/FDOrCsJ76lM?si=8bdcj2gjTApguA56&t=411)

### Activities in Hiroshima (2015-)

I started traveling to Tokyo to deepen my relationship with PyCon JP participants to hold events in Hiroshima.

- 2015: Started [PyCon mini Hiroshima](https://hiroshima.pycon.jp/2015/)
- 2016-2019: Participated in PyCon JP for 4 years
- 2018: Accepted a talk from Hiroshima "Solving a drawing puzzle with Python"

I also thought that the scale of the event in Tokyo was getting bigger and bigger, and it might be difficult to secure a venue in Tokyo in the future.

### Recent participation (2020-)

Even during the COVID-19 pandemic, I continued to participate online, and then I started to visit Tokyo again.

In 2024, I was an organizing member (participant management team), and I applied to be a chair for PyCon JP 2025, and then the Hiroshima event was announced.

- 2020: Online event
- 2021: Hybrid event
- 2022-2024: Participated in the event in Ariake

## For PyCon JP 2025

### Current considerations

- Establish the overall concept and theme
- Selection of keynote speakers
- Effective use of the venue
- Rich tutorials, workshops, and hands-on sessions

### Team structure

- Chair (tentative) team: Establish the overall concept, overall adjustment, accounting, policy operation
- Program team
- Sponsorship team
- Venue team
- Public relations team
- Participant management team

### About the vice chairs

We are recruiting someone who can create PyCon JP 2025 with a new perspective, considering future local events outside of Hiroshima. Inheriting knowledge for future events (2026 and later) is also an important role.

## Call for PyCon JP 2025 organizing members
