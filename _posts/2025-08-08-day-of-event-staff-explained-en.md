PyCon JP 2025 will be held at the Hiroshima International Conference Center from September 26 to 28, 2025 (the last day is development sprints).

[https://2025.pycon.jp/](https://2025.pycon.jp/)

PyCon JP is Japan's largest Python community event, a non-profit international conference organized mainly by Python community members.
This article is day 66 of my note continuous posting [#100-day challenge](https://note.com/hashtag/100%E6%97%A5%E3%83%81%E3%83%A3%E3%83%AC%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B8) as the chair.

**Do you recruit volunteer staff who help only on the day of the event?**

I sometimes receive this question.
It's not a final decision, but for now, the answer is "NO."

Instead, let me share a shocking fact with everyone.

## You Can Still Become an Organizing Member From Now

We haven't finished recruiting organizing members yet.

[**PyCon JP 2025 Organizing Member Application Form**](https://forms.gle/7irqYKhZVj7AY7LfA)

We distinguish between the words "staff" and "organizing members."
We use the word "staff" to refer to contractors and vendors who enter the venue.
We call volunteers who plan and operate with me **organizing members**.

Even now, two weeks after ticket sales started, we continue to recruit colleagues who will create this festival together with us.
No special skills or experience are required.
All that's needed is the feeling of "wanting to support the Python community" and "wanting to make the Hiroshima event a success."

If you want to know what kind of work there is, please check this out: [**Dialogue with Hiroshima-based Organizing Members**](https://pyconjp-2025-chair.nishimotz.com/hiroshima-member-dialogue.html)

### 【We're recruiting people skilled in networking】

The venue team asked me to mention that we're recruiting someone for network responsibilities.
Right now we're at a critical point where what we can do changes depending on whether we have people or not.
Actually, if I weren't the chair, this would be an opportunity to touch routers...

## PyCon JP's "Philosophy of Participation"

Wait, can't you participate for free by becoming an organizing member without buying a ticket?
Some people might think that way.
Let me explain our custom here.

I'm sometimes asked, but my chair work is unpaid.
Not only that, but at PyCon JP, all organizing members including myself pay the participation fee to attend the conference.
While not an explicit rule, speakers, participants, and organizing members are all equally colleagues who enjoy this place and support each other.
As an expression of this philosophy, everyone shares the costs of hosting by bearing a little bit of the burden.
We're following this policy this year too.

Organizing member tickets are priced differently from general participation fees, but people other than organizing members cannot purchase them (if purchased, they become invalid).

## Why Don't We Gather First?

"I understand the story, but applying suddenly seems like a high hurdle..." "I'd like to know more about what kind of people are doing this"

If you think this way, there's a perfect opportunity.

**On July 30 (Wed), the memorable 100th "Sugoi Hiroshima with Python" will be held in Hiroshima City.**

This event is a "loose" study group where Hiroshima's Python community gathers.

You're also welcome to just experience the atmosphere of Hiroshima's Python community.
People who are hesitating whether to buy general tickets are also welcome.
