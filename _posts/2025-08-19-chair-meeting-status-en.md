# Is the Preparation Going Smoothly?

40 days before the conference, Day 87 of the 100-day challenge.

## Chair Team Status Meeting Conducted

On Sunday evening, the Chair Team held an online status meeting. With 40 days remaining before the event, we needed to comprehensively review our preparation status.

### Meeting Content

We conducted detailed checks on the following items:

- Chair's list of concerns
- All items in the budget sheet
- Timeline items from the 2024 handover documentation
- Task lists for each team

We organized these items by urgency level and responsible teams to clarify our current situation.

### Challenges Identified

Through the meeting, we reached several important realizations:

#### Priority Adjustments Needed
Some plans need to have their priorities lowered due to realistic constraints.

#### High-Urgency Tasks
We recognized that some issues cannot be handled with a "if we don't finish this week, we'll continue next week" approach. Tasks with strict time constraints have become clear.

#### Organizational Challenges
When we finished organizing the list, we felt that we still haven't successfully built a system where organizing members can collaborate effectively by leveraging their respective time and skills.

### Future Focus Areas

We will focus intensively on the following points:

- Supporting tasks with tight time constraints
- Maximizing event value for participants, speakers, and organizing members

### Chair's Commitment

Regardless of the team's situation, I will face all stakeholders and all circumstances as the chair. By accurately understanding our current status 40 days before the event, I believe we can use the remaining time more effectively.
