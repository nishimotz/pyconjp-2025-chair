This is a personal daily report by PyCon JP 2025 Chair [@nishimotz](https://d.nishimotz.com/aboutme).

[PyCon JP 2025](https://2025.pycon.jp/) will be held at the Hiroshima International Conference Center on September 26-27. We are also planning to hold the traditional development sprints on September 28.

## Follow-up on Organizing Member Applications

Recently, I've noticed that some people who applied to become organizing members have not completed their Slack registration. As the Chair, I'm making efforts to ensure reliable communication with all applicants and help them start their activities smoothly, but several technical issues have emerged.

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Email Address Input Errors**
   - If there's a mistake in the email address field at the beginning of the application form, you won't receive the automatic response message.
   - Entering an accurate email address is the first step to receiving communications.

2. **Google Account Information Issues**
   - The application form doesn't automatically capture Google account information from your browser environment.
   - The Google account email address field on the next screen of the form is also important. If this is incorrect, it becomes even more difficult for the Chair to contact you.

3. **Slack Display Name Settings**
   - The form includes a field for your Slack Display name/username. This helps us identify you when you join Slack after receiving the invitation email.

4. **Jira Invitation Problems**
   - The email address you provide is also used for Jira invitations.
   - If you want to use Jira with a different email address, the Chair will need to resend the invitation.

5. **Multiple Account Issues from Past Activities**
   - If you have participated in PyCon JP before, you may have Slack or Jira accounts that are deactivated or have limited permissions.
   - For those who accidentally registered with multiple accounts, the Chair may have mistakenly invited you to incorrect channels, groups, or projects.

I'm working to resolve these issues and help you participate smoothly, but there are limitations to what I can do.

## Please Contact Us Again

The recruitment period for organizing members will eventually end. If you have applied but haven't received a Slack invitation email or haven't been able to join Slack, please contact us again using one of the following methods:

1. Use the contact form on the [PyCon JP 2025 official website](https://2025.pycon.jp/)
2. Re-enter accurate information in the [Organizing Member Application Form](https://forms.gle/7irqYKhZVj7AY7LfA)

## Message

I look forward to working with as many people as possible. The participation of organizing members with diverse skills and enthusiasm is essential for the success of PyCon JP 2025. To ensure you don't miss the opportunity to participate due to technical issues, please contact us again.
