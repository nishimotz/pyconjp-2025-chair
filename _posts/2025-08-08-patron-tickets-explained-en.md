Hello, this is Nishimotz, the Chair of PyCon JP 2025.

PyCon JP 2025 will be held at Hiroshima International Conference Center from September 26-28, 2025 (the final day is for development sprints). We're now just two months away! PyCon JP is Japan's largest Python community event, an international nonprofit conference organized primarily by Python community members.

Today, I want to explain **"Patron Tickets"**—a special type of ticket that's a bit different from others.

*This post is based on my [note article "What is a Patron Ticket?"](https://note.com/24motz/n/na043f140237d) from July 26, part of my #100-day challenge.*

## I've Been a Patron Before

When PyCon APAC 2023 was held instead of PyCon JP that year, I was a patron. Let me share a photo from the venue showing the patron recognition panel.

This experience gives me a personal perspective on what it means to be a patron, and I'd like to share that feeling with you today.

## What is a "Patron"?

First, let's understand what the word **"patron"** means. A patron is primarily someone who provides economic support as a "benefactor" in fields like arts, culture, and academia. Historically, famous examples include the Medici family, who supported Leonardo da Vinci.

From this meaning of "benefactor," special tickets to support events are called "patron tickets."

## The Patron Ticket Experience

Whether it's your favorite artist's concert, a creator's exhibition you want to support, or technical conferences like the one I participated in—many events involve "tickets." Among these, **"patron tickets" are special tickets purchased by adding a "support contribution (expression of support)" to the regular participation fee,** often with additional benefits.

It's a way to step beyond being just a "participant" and become a "benefactor (patron)" who supports the event—**a form of intentional declaration.**

## PyCon JP 2025 Patron Tickets

PyCon JP 2025 patron tickets differ from "Early Bird" tickets (which I discussed yesterday) in several ways:

### **Key Differences:**
- **Price**: Higher investment reflecting patron status
- **Official party participation rights**: Included (separate purchase for other tickets)
- **Name listing on official website**: Public recognition as a patron
- **Name display at venue**: Physical recognition during the event

The official party details will be explained separately later. For now, understand that **"the price difference includes some content differences too."**

**"Name listing" is proof of your patron status.** While the price is higher than regular tickets, I believe you gain even more value than the additional cost.

## My Personal Motivation

When I became a patron in 2023, I didn't have any grand reasons. However, looking back at this photo of the recognition panel now, **it's not just a record of participation, but a tangible sense that "I was also part of creating this wonderful experience."**

I certainly felt respect seeing the names and images of other patrons. Some are frequent PyCon JP participants, others have made significant contributions to the Python community, and some are active in social media engagement.

**When you see patron sponsors, it becomes a natural conversation starter:** "You're a patron sponsor, right?" Or alternatively, **becoming a patron yourself can be a way to create opportunities for others to approach you.**
