## Becoming an Organizing Member

**Hiro:** Mom, I've become an organizing member of PyCon JP 2025, but I'm anxious because I don't know what I should do.

**Mom:** It takes courage to try something new. But the chair says they "want to create an environment where inexperienced people can participate easily." So it's okay if you don't understand everything at first.

**Hiro:** But I've never been a leader before, and I might not be good at that kind of thing...

## Roles and Communication

**Mom:** The chair thinks the word "leader" isn't quite right. Leadership might be a skill, but it's not something only certain people can do. A leader isn't someone with special abilities, but rather a role of taking care of the team. That's why they said it's fine to rotate the role monthly.

**Hiro:** Really? The leader can change every month?

**Mom:** Yes. And conversely, people who are better at management than hands-on work can use their leadership skills. Not everyone has to contribute in the same way.

**Hiro:** I see... But isn't it our responsibility if we don't know what to do?

**Mom:** That's not the case. The chair believes that "if you don't know what to do, it's because the chair team hasn't prepared adequately." It's not the responsibility of the organizing members or teams. So feel free to ask questions. In fact, your simple questions help articulate things better and improve the environment.

**Hiro:** I see... So I should start by asking questions. But in remote work, doesn't it sometimes feel like everyone is busy, and you hesitate to help even when you want to?

**Mom:** That happens quite often. The chair also mentioned that with remote work, it's difficult to know how much capacity each person has, so people tend to hesitate to approach those who seem busy.

**Hiro:** That's true... So people with capacity should let others know?

**Mom:** Exactly. When someone says "I'm available" or "I can do this task," everyone feels more comfortable asking for help. The chair also said they'd like people to proactively communicate their availability.

## Moving Together

**Hiro:** But what does the chair do? We're the ones doing the work, right?

**Mom:** The chair is like "someone who teaches how to fish." But it's all the organizing members who actually do the fishing.

**Hiro:** What does that mean?

**Mom:** The chair explains how to proceed, shares methods, and provides support when needed. But it's the organizing members who actually move forward and create the event. So it's important to take what you've learned and think and act on your own.

**Hiro:** I see! So the chair teaches us "how to fish" so we can enjoy "fishing."

**Mom:** That's right! So if there's something you don't understand, just ask, and it's important to take initiative.

**Hiro:** Thanks, Mom. I'm starting to feel excited!

**Mom:** Yes, that's important! First, just try it. Have fun while you work hard!

## A Few Days Later

**Hiro:** I joined the publicity team. I'm thinking about social media posts and checking website content. I also participated in the [organizing member general session]({{ site.baseurl }}/2025/02/25/kickoff-en.html)!

**Mom:** general session? What did you learn?

**Hiro:** I learned a lot of important things about being an organizing member. Let me tell you what I understood!

## Valuing Your Health and Happiness

**Hiro:** First, it's important to prioritize your own happiness.

**Mom:** What does that mean?

**Hiro:** Event preparation is fun, but you shouldn't get too tired. It's like practicing too much before a soccer match and then not having energy for the actual game. It's important to rest properly and take care of your health.

**Mom:** I see, that's important. Your health comes first.

**Hiro:** Yes! And above all, it's important to enjoy yourself. People naturally gather around someone who's having fun.

## Caring for Everyone

**Hiro:** It's also important to think about different kinds of people.

**Mom:** Different kinds of people?

**Hiro:** Yes, for example, everyone has different food preferences, so we need to prepare food that everyone can eat, including vegetarians and people with allergies.

**Mom:** That's right, it's not just about preferences but also about health and safety concerns, so such consideration is very important.

**Hiro:** Also, we prepare English information for people who don't understand Japanese, and think about childcare services for people with small children. We also consider venue accessibility for wheelchair users.

**Mom:** That's wonderful. Making efforts so that various people can participate is very important.

## Protecting Personal Information

**Hiro:** Protecting personal information is also very important.

**Mom:** What does that involve?

**Hiro:** For example, we only collect participants' names and contact information when necessary, and we store that information carefully. It's like not sharing a friend's secret with others without permission.

**Mom:** Yes, such consideration is necessary to build trust.

## Communicating Accurately

**Hiro:** It's also important to communicate information accurately. We need to check and write people's names and company names correctly.

**Mom:** That's important. It feels bad when someone gets your name wrong.

**Hiro:** Yes! And on social media, we use the hashtag #PyConJP2025. By being consistent, it makes it easier for everyone to find information.

## Cooperating as a Team

**Hiro:** The most important thing is to cooperate as a team. One person can't create a big event alone, so it's important to combine everyone's strengths.

**Mom:** That's right, it's like soccer. Teamwork is important in both sports and event management.

**Hiro:** Yes! And if there's something you don't understand, it's important to consult with the chair right away. It's important not to try to handle everything alone.

## Feeling Growth

**Mom:** Hiro, do you feel you've changed since becoming an organizing member?

**Hiro:** Yes, I feel like I have a stronger sense of responsibility than before. And I'm less nervous talking to people I don't know.

**Mom:** That's wonderful. I can sense your growth.

**Hiro:** Also, I've become a bit interested in Python. I thought programming was difficult at first, but now I'm thinking about studying it little by little.

**Mom:** That's great. Having the courage to try new things is wonderful.

**Hiro:** Yes! I'm really glad I became an organizing member of PyCon JP. I'll keep doing my best!

**Mom:** Hiro, I'm supporting you. If you have any problems, feel free to talk to me anytime.

**Hiro:** Thanks, Mom!
