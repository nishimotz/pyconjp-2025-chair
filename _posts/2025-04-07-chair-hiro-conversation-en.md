This is a daily report published by [@nishimotz](https://d.nishimotz.com/aboutme), the Chair of PyCon JP 2025, in a personal capacity.

[PyCon JP 2025](https://2025.pycon.jp/) will be held at Hiroshima International Conference Center on September 26-27.

## Conversation between Chair and Hiro: Team Building for Organizing Members

As we enter April, preparations for PyCon JP 2025 are gaining momentum. Today, I'd like to share a conversation I had with Vice Chair Hiro about team building for our organizing members.

**Nishimoto (Chair)**: Hiro, how are the activities of each team progressing now that we're in April?

**Hiro (Vice Chair)**: Yes, each team is gradually getting into motion. The Program Team has started preparing for the CFP, and the Sponsor Team is finalizing the sponsor packages.

**Nishimoto**: That's right. However, some teams still don't have enough organizing members. I feel that the Venue Team, in particular, needs more local collaborators in Hiroshima.

**Hiro**: Indeed. Since we're holding the event in Hiroshima, cooperation from local people is essential. Having people familiar with the local situation would be especially helpful for venue setup and day-of-event operations.

**Nishimoto**: That's why I'm thinking about holding a meeting for organizing members in Hiroshima in mid-May. I believe that creating opportunities to meet in person, not just online, will strengthen team cohesion.

**Hiro**: That's a great idea. There are limitations to online communication alone. We can also inspect the venue and make it easier for local people to participate.

**Nishimoto**: Exactly. Also, I'd like the leaders of each team to take more initiative. Rather than having the Chair Team make all the decisions, I want to create an environment where each team can operate autonomously.

**Hiro**: I see. That aligns with our slogan, "pieces of python, coming together." Each person fulfills their role while collectively creating a single event.

**Nishimoto**: Precisely. Each team expresses "what they want to do," and we adjust the overall direction while respecting those opinions. That's the kind of team building I'm aiming for.

**Hiro**: Communication between teams will also be important. For example, decisions made by the Program Team can affect the preparations of the Venue Team.

**Nishimoto**: Yes. For that reason, I want to continue regular general meetings while also activating information sharing on Slack. It would also be good if we could make task management for each team more visible.

**Hiro**: How about using GitHub Issues and Project features? We used them in the previous PyCon JP, and it made task progress more visible.

**Nishimoto**: That's a good idea. Let's propose it at the next general meeting. Also, I'd like to strengthen onboarding for newly joined organizing members.

**Hiro**: For onboarding, how about introducing a "buddy system"? Pairing experienced members with new members to create an environment where it's easy to ask questions.

**Nishimoto**: That's a wonderful idea! Especially for those involved in organizing PyCon JP for the first time, there will be many things they don't understand. I'd definitely like to implement that.

**Hiro**: Also, I think it's important to accumulate small successful experiences to maintain motivation. For example, sharing and celebrating small achievements from each team with everyone.

**Nishimoto**: Yes, "sharing small successes" is important. Let's set aside time to share "good news of the week" from each team starting from the next meeting.

**Hiro**: Finally, I think it's important to clarify milestones leading up to the main event in September. It would be good to have a timeline that everyone can share, indicating what should be decided by when.

**Nishimoto**: You're absolutely right. Let's create a detailed timeline by the Hiroshima meeting in May. Based on that, each team can establish their own schedules.

**Hiro**: Understood. Let's continue to create a wonderful PyCon JP 2025 together!

**Nishimoto**: Thank you. In the spirit of "pieces of python, coming together," let's value each piece and aim for a fantastic event!
