Hello, this is Nishimotz, the Chair of PyCon JP 2025.

PyCon JP 2025 will be held at Hiroshima International Conference Center from September 26-28, 2025 (the final day is for development sprints). PyCon JP is Japan's largest Python community event, an international nonprofit conference organized primarily by Python community members.

*This post is based on my [note article "Where Does Our Goodwill Flow?"](https://note.com/24motz/n/n717187624f86) from August 8, part of my #100-day challenge.*

## The Deprecator

August 6, 2025, Hiroshima.

The morning sun's brightness is known to all, yet the shadows within our hearts remain hidden. At the Peace Memorial Museum, countless lights flicker like fireflies. In the darkness, past and future prayers intertwine, creating a mosaic of souls flowing toward tomorrow.

In this age of artificial intelligence, we stand at a crossroads where technology and humanity intersect. The algorithms we create, the data we process, the decisions we automateâ€”where does our goodwill flow in this digital landscape?

As we prepare for PyCon JP 2025 in Hiroshima, a city that knows both destruction and renewal, we must ask ourselves: How do we ensure that our technological progress serves humanity's highest aspirations?

The Python community has always been about bringing people together, sharing knowledge, and building tools that make the world better. In Hiroshima, we'll explore not just what we can build, but what we should build.

Our goodwill flows through every line of code we write, every algorithm we design, every decision we make about how technology should serve society. Let us gather in Hiroshima to ensure that flow leads toward a future we can all be proud of.
