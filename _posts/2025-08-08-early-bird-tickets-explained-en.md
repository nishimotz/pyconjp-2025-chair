PyCon JP is Japan's largest Python community event, a non-profit international conference organized mainly by Python community members.

This article is day 62 of my note continuous posting [#100-day challenge](https://note.com/hashtag/100%E6%97%A5%E3%83%81%E3%83%A3%E3%83%AC%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B8) as the chair.

Actually, we had already started sales, but we published the ticket sales announcement on the official blog.

Today I'll explain PyCon JP 2025's "early bird tickets."

## What does "early bird" mean?

"Early Bird," literally translated, means "early-rising bird."
This comes from the English proverb "The early bird catches the worm."
It has the same meaning as the Japanese saying "早起きは三文の徳" (early rising brings three coins of profit).

From this proverb, in the events and services field, **"discounts for early purchasers"**, so-called **"early discounts"**, are called "early bird."

PyCon JP 2025's early bird tickets are, as the name suggests, **advance sale tickets that let you participate in the conference at a better price than regular pricing**.

## Why are there early bird tickets?

Some might wonder "Why bother preparing cheaper tickets?"
There are several important feelings from us organizers behind this.

### Gratitude to enthusiastic community members

We want to somehow express our gratitude to community members who always care about PyCon JP and have enthusiasm from early stages, thinking "I'll definitely participate once it's announced!"
From this feeling, we offer tickets at better prices.

### Early understanding of event scale

By looking at early bird ticket sales, we can know early on "how many people have strong interest in PyCon JP 2025."
This allows us to improve the accuracy of plans for venue layout, necessary equipment, and novelty goods order quantities, leading to smoother, higher-quality conference management.
Your early action becomes the power to make the conference better.

## The only difference from Personal tickets is price

There are no differences at all in the experience or rights provided between early bird tickets and personal tickets!

I know that some people, wanting to contribute more money to the organizers, purchase Personal tickets despite early bird stock being available.
Thank you.
I deeply appreciate it.

## To everyone who submitted proposals

Here, I have an important announcement for everyone who submitted many wonderful presentation proposals.

PyCon JP is an event created as one by all people - speakers, participants, staff, and sponsors - as "community members."
Based on this philosophy that "everyone is a participant and contributor," we want to support conference operations together and connect it to the future in a sustainable way.

From this feeling, PyCon JP 2025 has the following basic policies:

First, we ask speakers who will present to purchase conference participation tickets just like other participants. (We don't prepare so-called speaker-only free tickets)

Also, regardless of proposal acceptance results (accepted/rejected), we generally don't provide refunds for tickets once purchased.

On top of this, we must apologize to everyone again.
Due to scheduling, we had to start ticket sales before announcing proposal acceptance results.

We painfully understand that acceptance results are very important for applicants in deciding participation.
The feeling of wanting to purchase tickets after waiting for results is completely reasonable, and we sincerely apologize for this schedule.

While presenting such difficult conditions, organizing members have a strong wish.
That is, regardless of presentation acceptance results, to create the best conference where everyone thinks "I want to decide early to participate in the PyCon JP 2025 festival!" and "I want to truly enjoy interaction with the Python community in Hiroshima as a participant!"

These early bird tickets are our small token of gratitude to those who believe in PyCon JP's value itself and are quick to raise their hands saying "I'm going to Hiroshima!"

## About sponsor plan participation rights

Thank you very much to sponsor companies who always support and show interest in PyCon JP activities.

Sponsor plans include "conference participation rights" according to plan content.
We will individually contact each company's contact person later through the PyCon JP 2025 sponsor team regarding how to use these participation rights and registration procedures for participant information.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the sponsor team.

## Do you know Hiroshima Prefecture's bird?

Let me share some bird trivia related to early bird tickets.

Hiroshima Prefecture's "prefectural bird" is the "loon," a migratory bird.
Every winter, it comes to the Seto Inland Sea from the northern seas far away.
Long ago in Hiroshima's seas, there was traditional "loon fishing" where loons and humans cooperated.

This fishing mechanism is very suggestive for us today, especially those involved in technology.

First, flocks of loons use their sharp diving ability to drive small fish (sand lance) schools near the sea surface.
Sea bream and sea bass gather targeting those small fish.
Experienced fishermen carefully observe the loon flock movements and gently bring their boats to where fish schools are forming.
Then they accurately catch the fish that loons drove up using traditional single-hook fishing (hand fishing).

This relationship reminds me of "human-AI collaboration."
The loons' "driving" is AI's role.
AI analyzes vast amounts of data that we humans can't handle at high speed and discovers valuable patterns and trends (= fish schools).
And the fisherman's "catching" is our human role.
Based on insights AI provides, we generate creative ideas, formulate final business strategies, and create big value (= catch).

Like AI analyzing market data to identify promising trends (loon driving) and humans planning innovative new products from that information (fisherman's catch).
Each uses their strengths to achieve results that one (bird) alone couldn't accomplish.
Thinking that hints for future working styles existed in this traditional Hiroshima fishing makes me excited.

At PyCon JP 2025 too, there should be many stimulating discussions where cutting-edge technology intersects with our human wisdom using it.
