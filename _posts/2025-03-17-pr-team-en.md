## Aspirations for the Public Relations Team

### Communicating the Change of Venue

* We need to communicate to as many people as possible, as early as possible, that PyCon JP will not be held in Tokyo this year.

### Collaboration with Stakeholders

* PR activities are not tasks to be carried out by the PR team alone. Recipients value messages from people who are close to them or with whom they can empathize.
* Supporting all organizing members, sponsors, and speakers in promoting PyCon JP from their respective positions is also an expected role of the PR team. In fact, the PR team should be considered as "backend support for PR activities involving everyone."
* Many of the PR team's tasks require collaboration with other teams. If coordination is not smooth, the Chair team will provide support.

### Reaching Diverse Participant Groups

* Python is now used by a wide range of people, from programming beginners to experts. At PyCon JP 2025, we aim to actively approach people who have never participated in PyCon JP before and welcome a more diverse group of participants.
* We will demonstrate through our PR activities a welcoming attitude toward newcomers, such as those living in regional areas, students, and participants from different industries.

### Transparent Information Sharing

* We will strive for timely and transparent sharing of information about event preparations and decisions.
* We will announce important dates and changes as early as possible so that speakers, sponsors, and participants can plan with confidence. In particular, information about transportation and accommodation is crucial for participants.

### Appropriate Content

* The [Organizer Training Materials]({{ site.baseurl }}/2025/02/25/kickoff-en.html) contain items related to PR activities.
* For example, they suggest unifying hashtags and ensuring accurate notation.
* We will create and select content with respect for intellectual property rights.
* We will avoid messages that may offend people of specific positions.
* In cases where judgment is difficult, we will work with the Chair team to address the issue.

### Universal Information Dissemination

* At the previous PyCon JP 2024, about 10% of participants were from outside Japan. We will always ensure that information dissemination in English is sufficient and promote international participation.
* There are improvements to make PR effective that can be undertaken even without being a designer. For example, utilize knowledge of accessibility and universal design to make information accessible to elderly and disabled people.
* Pay attention to the readability of text in blog posts, displays, and handouts, which is also important from an accessibility perspective.
* We also welcome measures such as alternative text for images on social media.
* These will be organized as PR tool operation guidelines, and unclear points will be decided in consultation with the Chair.
