Hello, this is Nishimotz, the Chair of PyCon JP 2025.

PyCon JP 2025 will be held at Hiroshima International Conference Center from September 26-28, 2025 (the final day is for development sprints). PyCon JP is Japan's largest Python community event, an international nonprofit conference organized primarily by Python community members.

Today I want to introduce our **U25 Tickets**.

*This post is based on my [note article "What is a U25 Ticket?"](https://note.com/24motz/n/n5661a9ae5b3d) from July 27, part of my #100-day challenge.*

## What is U25?

U25 stands for "Under 25 (25 years old or younger)." This designation has been widely used in the cultural and artistic world—theaters, classical concerts, art museums—long before the IT industry adopted it.

The philosophy behind it is: "We want young people, who are the future bearers of culture, to have opportunities to experience authentic art while they're still young."

Even the most wonderful performances and works cannot continue into the future without people to watch, appreciate, and support them. **U25 discounts are an investment in the future.**

We offer U25 tickets at PyCon JP with the same spirit. We want to pass on Python technology and the "culture" of the community that surrounds it to the next generation.

## Reclaiming the "Connections" That COVID-19 Took Away

This sentiment took concrete form last year, with COVID-19 as the backdrop. As we explained in our PyCon JP 2024 blog:

Society was struck by the COVID-19 pandemic, and remote work rapidly became widespread. As a result, tech communities and in-person events decreased dramatically. Young people who started their careers as new graduates during this period were forced into remote work even within their companies, with almost no opportunities to engage with tech communities.

There are many new ways to learn technology—YouTube, generative AI, technical doujinshi (self-published technical books), and more. However, the unique energy of conferences, the chemical reactions born from chance encounters, and connections with peers who share the same goals are irreplaceable.

Especially for young engineers who have just entered society, such community connections hold immeasurable value not only for technical growth, but also for thinking about their careers and maintaining motivation.

## 2025: Connecting Hearts in Hiroshima

This year's theme is "pieces of python, coming together"—a message about creating new value by bringing together diverse people beyond barriers of technology, experience, affiliation, and age.

The perspectives and energy of the U25 generation, who have overcome COVID-19 and explored new ways of working and learning, are indispensable "pieces" for the future Python community and PyCon JP.

## To Our Fellow Generation of This Year's Keynote Speaker

PyCon JP 2025 is special for the U25 generation for another reason: one of this year's keynote speakers is likely the youngest in PyCon JP history.

**Ami Otsuka**, who calls herself "first generation raised by generative AI," achieved the challenge of developing 100 apps in 100 days while still a university student, quickly making her name known. She's a top runner in the U25 generation—your generation.

Keynote speakers at technical conferences are often veterans with many years of experience in their field. However, we decided to invite Ami Otsuka this time. This is my message that the ones who will create the future are undoubtedly the young generation—people like you.

**Age and years of experience alone don't determine an engineer's value.** With overflowing passion, ideas unconstrained by convention, and the power to fearlessly make new technology your weapon, anyone can become the protagonist of our community.

Ami's keynote appearance will eloquently demonstrate this fact more than anything else.

## You Are Also a Witness to This Story

**U25 tickets are not just discount tickets.** They are "front-row invitations" to witness moments when young talents like you shine and to see the dawn of a new era.

What will an engineer of your same age speak about at Japan's largest conference, and what kind of future will they envision? That sight will surely ignite something in your hearts and give you great courage and inspiration.

Having you feel "Maybe I'm next"—that's one of the things we want to achieve at this conference.

Please come experience the moment when the future moves, right here in Hiroshima. And together with Ami and engineers gathered from across the country, find your own new piece.
