This is a daily report published by [@nishimotz](https://d.nishimotz.com/aboutme), the Chair of PyCon JP 2025, in a personal capacity.

[PyCon JP 2025](https://2025.pycon.jp/) will be held at Hiroshima International Conference Center on September 26-27.

We are recruiting organizing members. Please apply through the [Organizing Member Application Form](https://forms.gle/7irqYKhZVj7AY7LfA).



## Reflections on the Role of the Chair

### The Chair's Role and Appointment

Each year, the PyCon JP Association appoints a Chair who is responsible for organizing PyCon JP. This is an important mechanism for incorporating fresh perspectives annually within a continuous operational framework.

The association publicly discloses its financial information, and this transparency helps build trust with sponsors. This trust relationship is crucial for ensuring the sustainability of the conference.

### Experience as This Year's Chair

As this year's Chair (nishimotz), I don't have extensive experience in organizing PyCon JP, but I have long observed the conference as a participant and speaker. I also have experience working with RubyKaigi and YAPC, as well as organizing technical events in Hiroshima, which has given me exposure to various conference management approaches.

### The Evolving Python and Its Community

Python in 2011 is not the same as Python in 2025. The users and community have also changed, and PyCon JP should evolve accordingly. Rather than adhering to past successes, we need to create an event that responds to the current needs of the community.

### The New Challenge of Hosting in Hiroshima

The new challenge of hosting in Hiroshima has brought an increase in inexperienced organizing members. While this offers an excellent opportunity for diverse perspectives, it also increases the importance of carefully examining past experiences and developing this year's approach step by step.

### Balancing Guidelines and Innovation

As Chair, I've been given guidelines by the association on "how PyCon JP should be organized." However, this does not conflict with the idea that "this year's event should be run in this year's way." Rather, I believe it's important to incorporate creativity unique to each year within consistent guidelines.

### Diversity Through Chair Rotation

The system of appointing a new Chair each year can achieve its ideal when Chairs actually rotate frequently, allowing the event to be managed in different ways and creating a space where diverse values constantly intersect. This is a key element that creates PyCon JP's uniqueness.

### Continuous Learning and Challenges

The 2025 organizing members continue to learn from both past successes and failures. However, rather than simply following the past, we want to move forward without fear of new challenges.

### Request

I ask that you trust the goal in the Chair's mind and run together with us for the next five months. As Chair, I will do my utmost to support each organizing member in maximizing their potential in their respective roles.
