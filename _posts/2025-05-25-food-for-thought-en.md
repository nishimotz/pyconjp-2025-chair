This is a daily report published personally by [@nishimotz](https://d.nishimotz.com/aboutme), Chair of PyCon JP 2025.

## To Those Outside the Organizing Team

This article is not written to provide answers to questions.

Please understand that the respective team members of the organizing committee are responsible for answering questions.

If you have any questions, please use the "Contact Us" form on the official [PyCon JP 2025](https://2025.pycon.jp/) website.

## To All Organizing Team Members

This "Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) List" is a compilation of questions that we, the organizing members, anticipate might be asked by external parties interested in PyCon JP 2025 (such as attendees, sponsors, speakers, etc.).

We would like you to look at the questions in this list and think, "If I were asked this question, how would I answer it?"

Furthermore, we encourage you to discuss within your teams, "What should our team prepare to answer this question accurately?"

Examples of how to use this list:

* Each team creates draft answers for relevant questions. "Our team should probably answer this question."
* Discuss answers to some questions in team meetings. "Discussing this question as a team should lead to a better answer."
* If you think of other potential questions, please let the Chair know.
* Each team should consider providing answers to these questions as an FAQ or think about how to provide this information.

We hope this FAQ list will serve as a "food for thought" to help us all consider what is necessary to lead PyCon JP 2025 to success and what preparations we should make to create the best event together.
