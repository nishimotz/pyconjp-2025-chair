## Introduction

In my previous article "[The Chair's Job is to Visualize Work and Have Members Take It Away]({{ site.baseurl }}/visualizing-work-for-delegation-en.html)," I wrote about ideal delegation practices. I described an idealistic model where members proactively "take away" work.

However, in real organizational management, not all organizing members can be that proactive. Today, I want to explore a more realistic delegation system.

## The Reality of the 2-6-2 Rule

The "2-6-2 rule" mentioned in "[Planning Study Sessions for Organizing Members]({{ site.baseurl }}/2024/12/07/onboarding-study.html)" represents the reality of team activities:

- **20%**: Members who act proactively, finding and taking on work themselves
- **60%**: Members who respond to situations and reliably complete assigned tasks
- **20%**: Members who act cautiously and demonstrate their abilities with proper support

Given this rule, the idealistic model of "having work taken away" primarily applies to the first 20% of members. The remaining 80% require different approaches.

## Building a Multi-layered Delegation System

### Stage 1: From Chair to Leaders and Sub-leaders

It's unrealistic for the chair to delegate work directly to all members. First, team leaders and sub-leaders take on the role of "pulling away" work from the chair.

Leaders and sub-leaders have the following responsibilities:

- Proactively taking on work that the chair has made visible
- Breaking down and redistributing work within the team
- Appropriately assigning work based on member characteristics

### Stage 2: From Leaders to Team Members

For the 60% of members who "can handle assigned work," leaders and sub-leaders appropriately assign tasks. What's important here is:

- **Clear instructions**: Specifically communicating what, when, and how to do something
- **Appropriate sizing**: Breaking down tasks to match member skill levels
- **Support systems**: Creating an environment where members can consult when in trouble

### Stage 3: Individual Support and Growth Assistance

The 20% of members who act cautiously, or members who "have motivation but struggle to contribute effectively," need more careful support:

- **One-on-one dialogue**: Understanding individual situations and challenges
- **Gradual participation**: Starting with small success experiences
- **Pair work**: Collaboration with experienced members

## The Chair Team's Monitoring Function

The chair team currently monitors whether each organizing member is able to contribute effectively, watching over the entire organization with interest. This monitoring function includes the following elements:

### Early Detection System

- **Activity status tracking**: Regularly checking each member's participation and contribution levels
- **Problem indicators**: Early detection of motivation decline or isolation
- **Communication patterns**: Changes in frequency and content of Slack messages

### Intervention and Support

Response when problems are discovered:

- **Direct dialogue**: Individual approaches from the chair or leaders
- **Environmental adjustments**: Reviewing team assignments or redefining roles
- **Additional support**: Providing mentoring or pair work opportunities

## What We Expect from Leaders and Sub-leaders

For this multi-layered delegation system to function, there are expectations we have for our leaders and sub-leaders.

As mentioned in previous articles, leaders and sub-leaders serve as "contact persons" and can be rotated. However, what's important here is that **while they don't need to be hands-on workers themselves, they should connect people to people, teams to teams, and support people's activities**.

### Required Skills

- **Delegation techniques**: Appropriate task breakdown and explanation
- **Member understanding**: Grasping individual characteristics and situations
- **Communication**: Skills in instruction, consultation, and feedback
- **Problem-solving**: Early detection and response to issues

### Support Systems

- **Regular meetings**: Information sharing between chair and leaders
- **Experience sharing**: Accumulating success and failure cases
- **Continuous learning**: Opportunities to improve leadership skills

## Addressing Members Who Feel "Unable to Contribute"

For members who have motivation but struggle to contribute effectively, we take the following approaches:

### Identifying Causes

- **Skill issues**: Lack of necessary technical knowledge or skills
- **Environmental issues**: Time constraints or physical limitations
- **Communication issues**: Relationships or information sharing within the team
- **Role issues**: Assignment of work that doesn't match their aptitude

### Specific Support Measures

- **Skill support**: Providing training and study sessions
- **Environmental adjustments**: Considering flexible participation formats
- **Communication improvement**: Increasing one-on-one dialogue opportunities
- **Role redefinition**: Reassigning work that matches their aptitude

## Integration with Working Out Loud

The practice of Working Out Loud described in "[Communication That Seems Excessive]({{ site.baseurl }}/working-out-loud-en.html)" is an important element supporting this multi-layered delegation system:

- **Improved transparency**: Visualizing who is doing what at which stage
- **Early detection**: Sharing signs of problems and challenges across the team
- **Learning opportunities**: Providing chances to learn from other members' efforts

## Integration with People-Centered Organization Building

The philosophy described in "[Adapting Organization to People]({{ site.baseurl }}/adapting-organization-to-people-en.html)" forms the foundation of this multi-layered delegation system:

- **Respecting individuality**: Providing roles that match member characteristics
- **Flexible systems**: Management not bound by rigid organizational structures
- **Growth support**: Supporting growth at each person's own pace

## Preventing Organizational Stagnation

### Addressing "Don't Know, So Don't Do Anything" Situations

When everyone says "I don't know what to do, so I won't do anything," volunteer organizations cannot create good events. To prevent this situation, we have established the following mechanisms:

#### Responsibilities of Leaders and Sub-leaders

When leaders or sub-leaders are temporarily unable to function adequately:

- **Securing alternatives**: Actively seeking people who can take responsibility
- **Sharing situations**: Early communication of concerning situations to the chair team and team members
- **Maintaining transparency**: Consulting openly rather than keeping problems to themselves

#### Direct Support from Chair Team

When there are no proactive members available:

- **Chair intervention**: The chair directly engages in team management when necessary
- **Dispatching supporters**: Experienced members from the chair team provide support to help teams function
- **Temporary structural changes**: Reviewing team composition and role assignments

#### Escalation Process

For early detection and response to problems:

1. **Team level**: Situation assessment by leaders and sub-leaders
2. **Chair team level**: Regular confirmation of team situations
3. **Emergency response**: Immediate construction of support systems when needed

## Current Implementation Status

In PyCon JP 2025 operations, this multi-layered delegation system is already being practiced:

- **Active team leaders**: Leaders who proactively take on work are developing in each team
- **Individual support implementation**: We're providing individual responses to struggling members
- **Overall monitoring**: The chair team conducts continuous monitoring
- **Escalation functionality**: We've built a rapid response system for when problems arise

## Decision-Making and Delegation Under Time Constraints

### Transition from "Publish When Ready" to "Must Be Done by Date"

Until now, we've managed with "publish something when it's ready," but from now on, we'll have more tasks that "must be completed by a specific date." To respond to this change:

#### Mechanisms to Reduce Time Waste

- **Distinguishing decision types**: Separating decisions that can be made quickly from those requiring careful consideration
- **Promoting team self-direction**: Clarifying decision-making authority at the leader and sub-leader levels
- **Efficient processes**: Reducing unnecessary meetings and approval processes

#### Using Different Approaches Based on Decision Types

**Quick Decision Type**:
- Technical implementation methods
- Daily operational judgments
- Matters requiring emergency response

**Full Consensus Type**:
- Important decisions related to branding (such as logo design)
- Policies that significantly impact participant experience
- Judgments related to organizational values

#### Case Study: Logo Decision Process

In the recent logo decision process, time was taken for discussions that went beyond the responsible team:

- **Broad opinion collection**: Gathering perspectives from multiple teams
- **Sufficient consideration time**: Not rushing, emphasizing high-quality discussion
- **Consensus-building process**: Aiming for conclusions that everyone can accept

As shown, it's important to select appropriate decision-making processes based on the nature of the task.

## Future Challenges and Prospects

### Continuous Improvement

- **System refinement**: Building more effective delegation processes
- **Leader development**: Discovering and nurturing next-generation leaders
- **Evaluation and improvement**: Measuring system effectiveness and continuous improvement
- **Decision-making process optimization**: Balancing time constraints with consensus building

### Handover to 2026

The experience with this multi-layered delegation system will be valuable assets for the PyCon JP 2026 organizing team:

- **System documentation**: Systematizing processes and know-how
- **Case accumulation**: Recording success and failure cases
- **Improvement proposals**: Specific improvement suggestions for next time
