I have compiled the activity policies and tasks for the Sponsor Team.

## Aspirations for the Sponsor Team

PyCon JP 2025 will be held in Hiroshima, away from Tokyo for the first time. In this new challenge, the role of the Sponsor Team is extremely important. Below are the aspirations I would like to entrust to the Sponsor Team.

### Sponsor Participation from Across Japan and the World

At PyCon JP, we have created opportunities for sponsor companies to promote their products and services, strengthen their recruitment branding for Python engineers, and build mutually valuable relationships. Even though it's not being held in Tokyo, I expect that we can create valuable opportunities with sponsor companies, just as we have in past PyCon JP events. Let's design sponsor plans and operations that can provide the same or greater value in Hiroshima, our new venue.

### Challenging New Approaches

I hope the Sponsor Team will enjoy exploring unique promotional methods with sponsors who are seeking innovative approaches. By co-creating sponsor initiatives that leverage Hiroshima's unique characteristics with unconventional ideas, we can provide fresh experiences for both sponsors and participants.

### Addressing Challenges Associated with the Venue Change

Holding the event in Hiroshima is a new challenge, and different issues may arise compared to Tokyo. It's important to carefully address region-specific challenges, such as weather impacts on transportation, and learn from past experiences. Let's consider risk countermeasures and prepare alternatives to ensure sponsors and participants can attend with peace of mind.

### Developing Sponsors from Hiroshima and Neighboring Regions

We would like to receive support from companies and organizations with connections to Hiroshima as new sponsors. For local companies, this is an opportunity to promote themselves globally and potentially recruit remote engineers living in regional areas. By developing sponsors rooted in the region, we can deepen the significance of holding PyCon JP in Hiroshima.

### Thorough Research and Planning

At the planning stage, I recommend carefully researching feedback from past sponsors, interesting case studies from technical conferences held in regional areas, and information about conference support that sponsor companies consider successful. It may also be effective to conduct interviews with potential sponsor companies during the planning phase. Based on this information, let's design sponsor plans that maximize the unique value of holding the event in Hiroshima.

### Emphasis on Transparency and Integrity

Transparent decision-making and integrity towards all stakeholders, including participants and sponsors, are fundamental values for our operations. Let's ensure we keep our promises to sponsors and strive to provide value beyond their expectations.

### Responding from the Sponsor's Perspective

As Chair, nishimotz has experience sponsoring events and conferences as a representative of a small corporation. Many sponsor representatives have multiple options for support. Once they decide to support an event, they respond to requests from organizers despite their busy schedules. They want to receive necessary information at the right time, approach the event day with confidence, and achieve satisfactory results. As Chair, I will support the Sponsor Team to ensure sponsor representatives can have this experience.

It's also important to provide appropriate information and support so that sponsor companies can understand and comply with the code of conduct. Please refer to the [PyCon JP 2025 Organizer Training Materials]({{ site.baseurl }}/2025/02/25/kickoff-en.html). Let's clearly communicate PyCon JP's values and appropriate ways to interact with participants in advance to create an environment where sponsor companies can participate with confidence.

### Sharing the Concept

Recognizing that Python is now widely used by programming beginners, we will plan and manage PyCon JP 2025 to make it more interesting and accessible to people who have never participated in PyCon JP before.

We will communicate this PyCon JP 2025 concept to sponsors as well.

### Promoting Interaction Among Sponsors

Let's devise ways to provide opportunities for networking and information exchange among sponsors. By promoting networking between sponsor companies, PyCon JP becomes a valuable venue for business as well, leading to continued support.

I hope the Sponsor Team members will keep these aspirations in mind as they work to build relationships with sponsors supporting PyCon JP 2025.
