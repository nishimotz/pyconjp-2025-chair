## Introduction

As preparations for PyCon JP 2025 intensify, I received a consultation from a Hiroshima-based engineer who wanted to participate as a volunteer staff member but had limited time available.

I'm documenting this dialogue in July as a record of the current situation of organizing members in Hiroshima.

I believe that by repeating such dialogues, we can realize open event operations where more people can participate easily.

## Concerns About First-Time Volunteer Activities

The consultant became interested in Python through their work. However, this was their first volunteer activity, and they had the following concerns:

- Current work is very busy, with only about one day available on weekends
- Unsure how to participate when unable to meet other members directly
- Worried that Slack communication alone might make it difficult to grasp the team atmosphere

## Contributing Even with Limited Time

In response to these concerns, I conveyed that "you can absolutely contribute even with limited time." PyCon JP operations are supported by volunteers from various backgrounds, and there are participation methods suited to each person's circumstances.

### Participating as Event Day Staff

Taking advantage of being based in Hiroshima, there's the option to participate as operational staff on the event day. Day-of duties are diverse:

- **Venue Setup**: Directing and confirming with professional contractors
- **Food & Beverage**: Providing and transporting refreshments
- **Attendee Support**: Reception duties and sponsor support

However, rather than jumping in on the day, it's important to belong to a team beforehand and understand the information. Even if you can't attend every meeting, asynchronous catch-up through reading materials later or individual consultations is possible.

### Team Introduction

I introduced these four teams as accessible for first-time participants:

1. **Venue Team**: Handles day-of venue operations
2. **Sponsor Team**: Handles sponsor company relations
3. **Attendee Management Team**: Handles attendee reception
4. **PR Team**: Besides social media and blog writing, recently expanding regional activities like flyer distribution

The PR team has many remote-friendly tasks, but there are increasing opportunities for Hiroshima residents to be active locally.

## Flexible Ways to Contribute

Even if deep involvement with a specific team is difficult, there are contribution methods like:

### Participating as a Reviewer

Checking and providing feedback on PR materials and various decisions requires diverse perspectives, making it valuable contribution even with limited time.

### Providing Regional Knowledge

As a Hiroshima resident, providing information about local food, tourist spots, transportation, and accommodation becomes a valuable resource for attendees.

## Transparency in Operations

PyCon JP 2025 operations currently proceed as follows:

- **General Meeting (Work Day)**: Held on fixed weekday evenings via Zoom
- **Team Meetings**: Each team holds meetings at optimal days/times
- **Member Count**: About 60 registered, about 30 active members

I hope people will participate in general meetings and team meetings to interact with members of the teams they want to work with.

## Summary: Operations That Leverage Diversity

Through this dialogue, I recognized again that PyCon JP operations have the flexibility to accept diverse forms of participation. Even with limited time or geographical distance, there are contribution methods suited to each person's situation.

What's important is not forcing participation due to concerns about member shortages, but choosing teams that match what you want to do and your schedule. Then, gradually becoming familiar with the community using casual channels and other resources.
