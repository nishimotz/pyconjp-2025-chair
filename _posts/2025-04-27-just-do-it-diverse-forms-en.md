## Before "Just Do It"

As we prepare for the event, we sometimes find ourselves at a standstill. We may be unsure of what to do next or hesitant to take the first step. Many organizing members may have experienced this feeling.

In a video I've previously referenced, Masahiro Sakurai discusses the concept of "Just Do It" in his "Work Attitude" episode. He argues that what builds your skills and brings you closer to success is the number of attempts you make. The idea is that through numerous trials and errors, you grow and open the path to success.

Here's the video from "[Masahiro Sakurai on Creating Games](https://www.youtube.com/@sora_sakurai_jp)":

While this "Just Do It" message is powerful, as the Chair, I'd like to add a few thoughts.

## Prerequisites for "Just Do It" to Work

It's natural to feel unable to act immediately when told to "Just Do It." For this phrase to truly be effective, I believe there are several prerequisites.

### Prerequisite 1: The Right to Quit, Rest, or Step Away

PyCon JP organizing members have the right to quit, escape, or take a break at any time. As the Chair, I deeply respect this right. "Just Do It" doesn't mean "Do it no matter what." It's okay not to be perfect, it's okay to fail, and it's okay to start with small steps. I believe that "Just Do It" works best in an environment where people can approach tasks with this mindset.

### Prerequisite 2: Success and Growth Are Not Mandatory

Individual organizing members don't need to be motivated by "success" or "growth." While having such goals is wonderful, they are not requirements. I want to foster an atmosphere where everyone can work at their own pace without feeling pressured.

### Prerequisite 3: You Don't Have to Do It Alone

"Just Do It" doesn't mean "Do It Alone." It's perfectly fine to seek help from your team, the Chair, or other members. In fact, when you're stuck, reaching out to others can often open new paths forward.

### The Relationship Between Leaders and Organizing Members

As mentioned in my previous post "[Planning the Organizing Member Workshop]({{ site.baseurl }}/2024/12/07/onboarding-study.html)," the "2-6-2 rule" suggests that teams have various types of members. Leaders should understand and respect the characteristics of proactive members, situational actors, and cautious members. When encouraging someone to "Just Do It," it's important to tailor your approach to their individual personality. Sometimes specific instructions are needed, while other times it's better to respect autonomy and simply observe.

## The Diverse Forms of "Just Do It"

"Just Do It" doesn't necessarily mean pushing forward with your initial plan at all costs. Let me share a recent personal experience.

When entrusting a task to a team leader, I presented options like "make a decision," "decide how to decide," or "decide who will decide how to decide." After consideration, the leader made the decision to "return the responsibility from the team leader to the Chair team," explaining their reasoning and rationale.

I accepted and understood this decision. Did this move the work forward? Actually, yes. This decision enabled me to articulate the concept of "[Adapting the Organization to People](/adapting-organization-to-people-en.html)" in yesterday's post.

This is one form of "Just Do It." Making a reasoned decision to "not do something," "change the approach," or "return a responsibility" is also a valid action that moves things forward.

## When You're Stuck

If you're currently stuck on a task or having trouble moving forward, try these approaches:

1. Break the task down into smaller pieces
2. Consult with someone (including me as the Chair), or propose an online meeting
3. Articulate your situation to an AI assistant (this can help organize your thoughts)
4. Consider that deciding "not to do this" or "to change the approach" is also a valid option

Making a decision is also a form of "doing something." And that decision can lead to new insights and progress. As mentioned in my previous post "[Don't Postpone Decisions]({{ site.baseurl }}/2024/12/14/decisions.html)," appropriate decision-making is a crucial element in moving work forward.

## Relationship with Tools

The phrase "Just Do It" can sometimes be reinforced by tools. For example, as mentioned in my previous post "[Rethinking Ticket Systems]({{ site.baseurl }}/2024/12/02/rethinking-ticket-systems.html)," ticket systems can sometimes become tools that create pressure.

However, I don't intend to use ticket systems as tools to pressure people to "do things." They are simply means to record what we've thought, decided, and done. In some cases, particularly when we need to keep evidence for accounting or security purposes, they become somewhat obligatory.

Not being able to use a tool isn't a problem in itself. You can always ask someone for help. What's important is that we master the tools rather than letting the tools master us. Tools exist for people, not the other way around.
