Hello, this is Nishimotz, the Chair of PyCon JP 2025.

PyCon JP 2025 will be held at **Hiroshima International Conference Center** from September 26-28, 2025 (the final day is for development sprints). Our organizing members are currently preparing for venue site visits.

*This post is based on my [note article "What is Hiroshima International Conference Center?"](https://note.com/24motz/n/n4f6801257221) from June 6, part of my #100-day challenge.*

## Location: Southern Edge of Peace Memorial Park

**Hiroshima International Conference Center** opened in July 1989. It's located on the south side of "Peace Memorial Park" in central Hiroshima city. Right next to it stands the **Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum (East and West Buildings)**, with these three buildings lined up together.

All are designed based on the architectural philosophy stemming from world-renowned architect **Kenzo Tange**. The facility features a 2-story underground, 2-story above-ground structure with comprehensive barrier-free accessibility.

## Phoenix Hall: A Symbol of Rebirth and Hope

The main auditorium of Hiroshima International Conference Center is named **"Phoenix Hall."** This name carries special meaning.

**"Phoenix" (the immortal bird)** symbolizes how Hiroshima rose from ashes to be reborn as a city of peace. The name embodies the wish that this place serves as a venue for the "International City of Peace" to rise again and again, soaring toward the future.

At PyCon JP 2025, this hall of rebirth and hope will gather the wisdom and connections of the Python community. Our theme this year is **"pieces of python, coming together."** We want to create a space worthy of Phoenix Hall's name—where individual thoughts come together and take flight toward the next future.

## Don't Get Confused! Similar Venue Names

Hiroshima city has many halls with confusingly similar names, and some are very close to each other:

**Near Our Venue:**
- **Hiroshima Bunka Gakuen HBG Hall** (formerly Hiroshima Welfare Pension Hall)
- **JMS Asteel Plaza** (Hiroshima City Naka-ku facilities)

**Within Walking Distance:**
- **Hiroshima Prefectural Cultural Center** (Satellite Campus Hiroshima) - often used for Hiroshima IT engineer events, and also hosts traditional Hiroshima performing art "Kagura" (神楽). Wouldn't it be interesting if someone attended our Python conference and then went to see "serpent-slaying Kagura"?

**A Bit Further Away:**
- **Ueno Gakuen Hall** (formerly Hiroshima Postal Savings Hall)

Local people of certain generations might accidentally say "Welfare Pension" or "Postal Savings" out of habit. Among all these, we're grateful that Hiroshima International Conference Center's **"Phoenix Hall"** has kept its name unchanged since opening.

*To our organizing members doing site visits: please don't get lost!*

## Where Do You Enter the Building?

Let me share something that once confused me about the building entrances:

### From Peace Memorial Park (Main Entrance)
When walking through Peace Memorial Park, you'll enter through the **1st floor main entrance**. From there, you'll take escalators down to basement levels 1 and 2.

### By Taxi (Alternative Entrance)  
When arriving by taxi, you'll often be dropped off directly at the **basement level 1 car porch** on the building's south side. This might make you wonder "Is this the entrance?" Look for escalators, stairs, or elevators to go down and reach the familiar basement level 2 area.

### Where Will Registration Be?
- **YAPC::Hiroshima 2024**: Registration was on basement level 2
- **RubyKaigi 2017**: Registration was on basement level 1, in front of the car porch entrance

For PyCon JP 2025, our organizing members will decide after site visits. Regardless, regular attendees will primarily move between multiple rooms, mostly on basement level 2.

**I believe this facility's high convenience will be one of PyCon JP's major selling points!**
