Hello, I'm Nishimoto, Chair of PyCon JP 2025. This is day 53 of my #100-day challenge note series.

As we enter the full swing of summer in July 2025, preparations for PyCon JP 2025, scheduled for late September, are heating up. As chair, I sincerely hope that as many Pythonistas as possible from across Japan and around the world will come to Hiroshima to share unforgettable experiences.

However, when some of you heard about Hiroshima as our venue, you might have thought, **"That's a bit far"** or **"I'd like to participate, but the travel costs..."**

We want to fully support your **"I want to go"** feelings. One of the systems for this is our **"Travel Grant Support."**

*This post is based on my [note article "What is Travel Grant Support?"](https://note.com/24motz/n/nb1811c027a93) from July 16, part of my #100-day challenge.*

## My Experience in Pittsburgh

I myself was one of the recipients of a travel grant when I attended PyCon US 2025 held this year.

**Conference**: [PyCon US 2025](https://us.pycon.org/2025/)  
**Location**: Pittsburgh

When applying for the grant, I wrote honestly about my passion: **"Why do I want to go to Pittsburgh?"** and **"What do I want to gain from PyCon US?"** The process of articulating my thoughts also became a wonderful opportunity to reconfirm my participation goals.

Fortunately, I was selected for the grant, and the knowledge I gained in Pittsburgh, the people I met, the conference operations I observed, and the community energy I experienced were truly invaluable. **Every decision I make about what PyCon JP 2025 should be is now informed by what I saw and heard at PyCon US.**

For more details about this experience, see my [reflection article](https://note.com/24motz/n/n182577c9d8f0).

## Now It's Our Turn to Support You

**PyCon JP has always operated a travel grant support system.** Distance or economic reasons should never prevent valuable learning and networking opportunities from being lost.

### **Historical Context**
- **Previous years**: Support was primarily for those who had difficulty traveling to Tokyo
- **PyCon JP 2025**: Support targets those who are far from Hiroshima
- **Evolving approach**: While I can't predict exactly how this will change, the core mission remains the same

## The Foundation of Global Support

### **PSF Partnership**
One of the pillars supporting this travel grant system has been **grants from the PSF (Python Software Foundation)**. PSF is a global nonprofit organization that protects and nurtures the Python language, and we at PyCon JP also operate as members of the global Python community with their support.

**This travel grant support is also an "investment in the future" from Pythonistas around the world, including PSF.**

For more about PSF and their role in the Python community, see my [detailed article](https://note.com/24motz/n/na053b81d82ae).

I hope you'll come to know about this wonderful connection as well.

## Understanding Travel Grant Support

### **What Are Travel Grants?**
**Travel grants are financial assistance provided to help individuals attend conferences who might otherwise be unable to participate due to:**
- **Geographic distance** from the event location
- **Economic constraints** that make travel costs prohibitive
- **Educational or professional circumstances** where support would maximize learning impact

### **Why Do Conferences Offer Travel Grants?**
**The philosophy behind travel grants includes:**
- **Diversity and Inclusion**: Ensuring conferences represent the global Python community
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Bringing together diverse perspectives and experiences

- **Investment in Future**: Supporting individuals who will contribute back to the community

### **How Travel Grants Work**
**Typical grant process involves:**
1. **Application**: Submit a detailed application explaining your situation and goals
2. **Review**: Committee evaluates applications based on established criteria
3. **Selection**: Recipients are chosen and notified
4. **Support**: Financial assistance is provided (often as reimbursement)
5. **Participation**: Recipients attend the conference and contribute to the community
