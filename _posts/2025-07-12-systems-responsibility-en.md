As the Chair of PyCon JP 2025, I would like to share our approach to organizational management where "systems take responsibility, not people." This represents a fundamental shift from traditional management styles that place heavy burdens on individuals to a structure where collective decision-making and systematic processes bear the responsibility.

## The Core of Responsibility Distribution

The essence of "systems taking responsibility" lies in making time our ally. In many organizations, time constraints lead to responsibility concentration on individuals. When faced with "we must decide now" or "someone must take responsibility," specific people end up bearing heavy burdens.

However, we take a different approach. When important decisions are needed, we first ask "do we really need to decide right now?" In most cases, we find there's room for adjustment of several days to weeks. Using that time to hear more people's opinions and examine from various angles allows us to make decisions without regret.

## Layered Responsibility Structure

Our responsibility structure operates on multiple layers:

**General Incorporated Association Level**: Creates large-scale frameworks including codes of conduct and fundamental policies. Appoints the Chair and provides organizational guidelines.

**Chair Level**: Within the Association's framework, determines policies, gathers people, and creates systems. Makes decisions on conference direction and resource allocation.

**Team/Individual Level**: Executes specific tasks within the policies set by the Chair. Each team operates with clear authority and responsibility boundaries.

This layered structure ensures that no single person bears excessive responsibility, while maintaining clear accountability at each level.

## Ticket Decision-Making: A Concrete Example

Let me illustrate this with a concrete example of ticket sales decisions. When selling conference tickets, we face both irreversible and reversible decisions.

**Irreversible decisions** include:
- Actually selling tickets to participants
- Setting ticket prices
- Announcing sales dates

Once tickets are sold, we cannot easily cancel them. Price changes after announcement damage trust and fairness.

**Reversible decisions** include:
- Whether to increase capacity after sellout
- Adjusting sales methods or timing
- Modifying registration processes

The key insight is that we can break down large irreversible decisions into multiple smaller reversible decisions. For example, instead of selling 100 tickets at once, we might sell them in batches of 20 tickets five times. This allows us to observe the results of the first 20 ticket sales and adjust our approach for subsequent batches while keeping the core pricing and commitment intact.

This approach resembles the relationship between waterfall and agile methodologies - breaking large, risky decisions into smaller, manageable ones with feedback loops.

For irreversible decisions, sufficient review time is critical. When there isn't enough time for review, rather than forcing someone to make quick personal decisions, we prioritize schedule adjustments to secure review time and opportunities.

## The Heart of the Matter: Time for Review

The core of "systems taking responsibility" organizational management is taking time for everyone to review together. When making important irreversible decisions, instead of someone steeling themselves to make personal decisions, we adjust schedules to secure time and opportunities for review. We create an environment where all members, including both proactive and cautious individuals, can participate freely and constructively in reviews.

For irreversible decisions, sufficient review time is critical. When there isn't enough time for review, rather than forcing someone to make quick personal decisions, we prioritize schedule adjustments to secure review time and opportunities. All organizing members, including cautious individuals, must have free and constructive participation opportunities in reviews.

Working Out Loud practices make decision-making processes visible, allowing all members to understand progress. This enables early problem detection and constructive discussion.

## Learning and Growing as an Organization

When problems occur, instead of blaming individuals, we treat them as system improvement points, promoting growth as a learning organization. We recognize that deciding not to act or changing approaches are also valuable actions, creating a culture that values appropriate judgment-based non-action as valuable contribution.

By recording and visualizing decision-making processes, we ensure transparency that can be verified later. This clarifies "why we made that decision" and promotes organizational learning. Systems exist to support people, and we carefully design them so people aren't overwhelmed by systems.

## Conclusion

The essence of "systems taking responsibility, not people" organizational management is taking time for everyone to review together. When making important irreversible decisions, instead of someone steeling themselves to make personal decisions, we adjust schedules to secure review time and opportunities. We create an environment where all members, including both proactive and cautious individuals, can participate freely and constructively in reviews.

This approach creates sustainable organizational culture where responsibility is shared, decisions are well-considered, and every member can contribute meaningfully to our collective success.
