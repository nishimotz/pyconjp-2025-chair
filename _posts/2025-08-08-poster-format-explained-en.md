Hello, this is Nishimotz, the Chair of PyCon JP 2025.

PyCon JP 2025 will be held at Hiroshima International Conference Center from September 26-28, 2025 (the final day is for development sprints). Currently, we're accepting proposals! Why not consider presenting at Python's premier conference, PyCon JP?

**Proposal submission deadline: June 29**  
**Submit here**: https://pretalx.com/pycon-jp-2025/cfp

*This post is based on my [note article "What is Poster Format?"](https://note.com/24motz/n/n86b9498687c0) from June 2, part of my #100-day challenge.*

## What is a "Poster Presentation"?

PyCon JP 2025 proposals come in three formats:
- **Talk** (30 minutes)
- **Poster**
- **Community**

**"Poster? What's that?"** you might be wondering.

A **poster presentation** is a presentation style where you summarize what you want to present on a large paper (poster), and then introduce your topic through conversations with attendees in front of that displayed poster.

### How Poster Sessions Work:

- **Poster display area**: Posters are arranged in one section of the venue
- **Direct interaction**: Presenters explain directly to visitors who come to listen
- **Free movement**: Attendees can freely move around the venue between posters
- **Conversational format**: More intimate, discussion-based than formal talks

The detailed explanation of poster format for PyCon JP 2025 will be handled by our organizing members. Here, I'll share my experience as a past poster presenter to give you a sense of "what it's like."

## Core Time

While I don't know the official term, there's a designated time period when "presenters must be at their poster." Let's call this **"core time."**

This is a time set by organizers to make it easier for attendees to ask questions. Attendees can freely view posters outside of core time, but presenters must be at their posters during core time.

## Who is Poster Format Perfect For?

### **üåü First-Time Presenters**
Poster presentations are **more casual than slide-based oral presentations** and allow you to explain at your own pace. Perfect for your **"presentation debut"**!

### **üé® People Who Want to Show or Demonstrate**
Within space constraints, you can use tablets or PCs next to your poster for **live demonstrations**.

**"I'm an artist who creates art with Python. Please take a look."**

I saw this kind of poster presentation at PyCon US this year. **It's not just a festival for engineers!**

### **üî¨ Specialists in Particular Fields**
**Niche topics are very welcome.** It's a place to meet fellow enthusiasts with the same interests.

**Researchers and students**: Haven't you done poster presentations at academic conferences, within organizations, or at your school? If it's Python-related, **this is your chance!** You might be able to use that same poster!

Show your audience: **"People in this field use Python this way"** and expand their world. You might find unexpected colleagues, or someone might approach you saying, **"I used to do similar work."**

### **üåç People Who Want to Reach International Participants**
**Adding English explanations to your poster reaches more people.** Even if you're anxious about speaking English, if you prepare translations with AI beforehand, you can get through the day just by reading from your poster!

**Regardless of your English level, we're all Python community members.** Your enthusiasm will definitely get through. **With smartphone translation apps available, communicate with people gathered from around the world (in Hiroshima)!**

## Great for "Question Debut" Too!

When you participate in a conference as an attendee and find something interesting or want to know more details, **asking questions through a microphone during talk Q&A can be nerve-wracking.** Plus, session Q&A ends very quickly.

**With posters, you can naturally stop and say "hello" and start a conversation.** "What is this?" "How did you make it?" You can enjoy conversation without formality.

**Enjoy English conversations with international poster presenters too!**

## Poster Presentations at PyCon US

**Guido van Rossum**, Python's creator, reportedly visits poster presentations at PyCon US every year. In 2025, I spotted Guido in the poster area at the venue.

You might think **"posters are supporting actors,"** but they're **information-sharing venues treasured at PyCons worldwide.**

### The PyCon US 2025 Poster Experience

At PyCon US, the poster session was vibrant and well-attended, with:
- **High-quality research presentations** from universities and research institutions
- **Creative projects** showcasing artistic and innovative Python applications
- **Industry case studies** sharing real-world implementation experiences
- **Educational initiatives** demonstrating Python in teaching and learning

## My Personal Experience

**Poster presentations are especially recommended for people who feel "I'm not good at speaking" or "I lack confidence."**

**A poster isn't just paper. Your thoughts become an "entrance" that connects people to people.**

I've done poster presentations several times with my go-to topic **"Japanese Language Support for Screen Reader NVDA."** I'd stand with my laptop, giving demos while explaining. I even got speaker T-shirts, and had this strange realization: **"Ah, I'm being treated as a proper presenter."**

Eventually, people started saying **"Oh, you're presenting this again this year."** (Though I didn't continue consistently.)

Now, about the third format‚Äî**Community posters**‚ÄîI'll introduce that in a separate article.

**Speakers and Sponsors Still Wanted!**  
PyCon JP 2025 is still recruiting proposals (presenters) and sponsors!
