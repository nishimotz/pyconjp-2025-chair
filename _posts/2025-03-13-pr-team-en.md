## Aspirations for the Public Relations Team

PyCon JP 2025 will be held in Hiroshima, away from Tokyo for the first time. In this new challenge, the role of the Public Relations Team is extremely important. Below are the aspirations I would like to entrust to the Public Relations Team.

### Communicating the Significance of Holding the Event in Hiroshima

It is important to effectively communicate to the Python community, both domestic and international, the significance of PyCon JP being held in Hiroshima for the first time away from Tokyo. Let's share the unique characteristics and appeal of Hiroshima, as well as the meaning behind holding the event there, through various channels. By emphasizing the new possibilities created by a regional venue and the value of collaborating with local Python communities, we can spark interest among participants and raise expectations for the unique Hiroshima experience.

### Reaching Diverse Participant Groups

Python is now used by a wide range of people, from programming beginners to experts. At PyCon JP 2025, we aim to actively approach people who have never participated in PyCon JP before and welcome a more diverse group of participants. In particular, let's demonstrate through our PR activities a welcoming attitude toward new community members, such as those living in regional areas, students, and participants from different industries.

### Information Dissemination with an International Perspective

PyCon JP is an international event, and participants from overseas are just as important as those from within Japan. Let's enhance information dissemination in English and promote international participation by communicating the appeal of the Hiroshima venue to overseas Python communities. This can also be utilized as an opportunity to strengthen connections with Python communities in various Asian countries, leveraging the good accessibility from the Asian region.

### Transparent Information Sharing

Let's strive for timely and transparent sharing of information about event preparations and decisions. It is important to announce important dates and changes early so that participants can plan with confidence, and to respond sincerely to questions and concerns. In particular, information about transportation and accommodation related to the regional venue is crucial for participants' decision-making, so let's provide detailed and accurate information.

### PR Activities Reflecting Community Voices

PR activities should be two-way communication with the community. Let's actively collect feedback from participants through social media and blogs, and demonstrate a willingness to incorporate it into operations. By listening to community members' voices and developing PR activities that meet their needs and expectations, we can build stronger community bonds.

### Collaboration with Hiroshima's Local Community

Let's develop locally rooted PR activities through collaboration with Python and technology communities in Hiroshima and neighboring regions. By devising ways to convey Hiroshima's unique appeal, such as collaborating with local community events and introducing initiatives that leverage regional characteristics, we can create an atmosphere where the entire region comes together to support PyCon JP.

### Utilizing Diverse Media

Let's disseminate information by effectively combining various media such as blogs, social media, email newsletters, and press releases. It is important to understand the characteristics of each medium and select the optimal channel based on the content you want to convey and the target audience. Also, let's develop attractive and memorable PR activities by actively utilizing visual content (photos, videos, infographics, etc.).

### Contributing to Enhancing Sponsor Value

Let's conduct PR activities that enhance the value of sponsor companies in collaboration with the Sponsor Team. We can create meaningful points of contact between participants and sponsors through introductions of sponsor companies and their initiatives. PR support to promote the participation of new sponsor companies associated with the Hiroshima venue is also an important role.

### Long-term Perspective on Branding

PR activities for PyCon JP 2025 should contribute not only to encouraging participation in the event but also to the long-term enhancement of the PyCon JP brand value. Through consistent messaging and visual identity, let's clearly convey PyCon JP's values and the direction it aims for, building a foundation that supports the sustainable growth of the community.

I hope the Public Relations Team members will keep these aspirations in mind as they work on information dissemination and relationship building with participants for the success of PyCon JP 2025.
