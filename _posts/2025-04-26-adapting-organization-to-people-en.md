This is a daily report published personally by [@nishimotz](https://d.nishimotz.com/aboutme), Chair of PyCon JP 2025.

[PyCon JP 2025](https://2025.pycon.jp/) will be held at the Hiroshima International Conference Center on September 26-27.

We are recruiting organizing members. Please apply through the [organizing member application form](https://forms.gle/7irqYKhZVj7AY7LfA).



## Adapting the Organization to People

As we prepare for PyCon JP 2025, I strongly feel the importance of "adapting the organization to people." This is my personal opinion as the Chair, but it's something I'm particularly conscious of in this year's operations.

### Participation of Hiroshima Students

Many students from Hiroshima are participating as organizing members this time. While most of them have no experience in conference management, their enthusiasm and fresh perspectives are a great asset to PyCon JP 2025.

We want to welcome them wholeheartedly. Regardless of experience, each person's contribution embodies our theme "pieces of python, coming together."

### Not Forcing Precedent

I don't believe we can successfully achieve the challenge of holding the event in Hiroshima if experienced members force precedent on inexperienced ones while working. Rather, I want to value new perspectives and ideas, creating an environment where everyone can leverage their strengths.

I believe that building an organization flexibly according to the characteristics of our current members, rather than being bound by past methods, will lead to a better conference.

### Reconsidering the Designer's Role

The PR team has traditionally been responsible for design work such as logos. However, the designer participating this time deeply understands the problems I want to solve and is willing to contribute beyond the PR team's responsibilities.

As Chair, I've always recognized that design requires cross-team coordination. Therefore, I'm considering having the Chair team handle "consideration of design direction" and "logo decision process" while leaving logo announcement and related communications to the PR team.

### Toward Flexible Organization Management

These thoughts are my personal opinions as Chair at this point. However, I believe the policy of "adapting the organization to people" is important for making PyCon JP 2025 better.

I believe we can create an excellent conference by leveraging each participant's personality and strengths, creating an environment where everyone can perform at their best.

## Message to Everyone Outside the Organizing Team

Logo proposals for PyCon JP 2025 have already been made, and the organizing members are very excited to officially announce them.

Additionally, we will be working energetically during the upcoming holiday period on keynote speaker announcements, call for talks, sponsor recruitment, and ticket sales preparation. We look forward to your participation and support.
