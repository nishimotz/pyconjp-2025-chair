I'm Nishimotz, Chair of [PyCon JP 2025](https://2025.pycon.jp/).
This note is day 53 of my [#100-day challenge](https://note.com/hashtag/100%E6%97%A5%E3%83%81%E3%83%A3%E3%83%AC%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B8).

In July 2025, as we enter the height of summer, preparations for PyCon JP 2025, to be held at the end of September, are also heating up.
As chair, I sincerely wish for as many Pythonistas as possible from all over Japan and the world to come to Hiroshima and share an unforgettable experience.

However, upon hearing that the venue is in Hiroshima, some may feel "it's a bit far" or "I want to participate, but travel expenses..."
We want to wholeheartedly support your feeling of "wanting to go."
One of the systems for this is "travel grant support."

## The Experience I Gained in Pittsburgh

I myself was one of those who received this travel grant when I participated in PyCon US 2025 held this year.

The venue was Pittsburgh.
In my grant application, I honestly wrote about my enthusiasm: "Why do I want to go to Pittsburgh?" and "What do I want to gain from PyCon US?"
The process of putting my thoughts into words was also a wonderful opportunity to reconfirm my purpose for participation.

Fortunately, I was selected for the grant, and the knowledge gained in Pittsburgh, the people I met, the reality of conference management, and the energy of the community were truly valuable.
Each of my decisions about how PyCon JP 2025 should be is now being made based on what I saw and heard at PyCon US.

## Now, We Will Support You

PyCon JP has been providing travel grant support for a long time.
Valuable learning and networking opportunities should not be lost due to distance or financial reasons.
However, until now, the target was people who had difficulty going to Tokyo.
This year, the target is people who are far from Hiroshima.

I can't predict how this will change, but I think what we need to do won't change much.

One of the pillars supporting this travel grant system is the grant from PSF (Python Software Foundation).
PSF is a global non-profit organization that protects and nurtures the Python language, and we at PyCon JP also receive its support and operate as members of the global Python community.
This travel grant support is also an "investment in the future" from Pythonistas around the world, including PSF.

I would be happy if everyone could learn about this wonderful connection.

## Details and Diverse Support Systems

Details about the application method and schedule for the travel grant system will be announced on the official PyCon JP 2025 blog.

Let me add a bit of clarification here: there's another domestic travel support system that the PyCon JP Association provides for domestic Python communities.
**PyCon JP 2025's travel grant support** differs in targets, conditions, selection criteria, and support limits.
Although it might be confusing, we'll also provide details about these on the official blog.
Please check which one suits you or your affiliated community and apply accordingly.

## To Support Diverse Participation

We are thinking about ways to overcome various barriers to participation from multiple angles to enable more people to participate in PyCon JP 2025.
Currently, what we have prepared as clear systems are low-priced tickets for specific participants and the travel fee support (a kind of cashback) introduced today.
I'll explain about tickets on another day.

Our efforts don't stop here.
We plan to make new announcements in the future, aiming for a conference that eliminates certain inequalities and where everyone feels welcome.
We wholeheartedly welcome suggestions from everyone.

If you have opinions like "this would make participation easier," please use the **contact form** on the official website.

I believe that having the entire team consider suggestions through official channels, rather than contacting me personally, leads to creating a better conference.

## Let's Meet in Hiroshima

I sincerely look forward to your enthusiastic applications and constructive suggestions.
I'm excited to meet you in Hiroshima at the end of September!
